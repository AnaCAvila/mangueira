1. If mature forests can't keep on stocking carbon forever, and the area for secondary forests is limited - HOW MUCH is the total carbon sequestration potential of forested areas in the world, and when are we going to need other mitigation strategies as our carbon footprint excedes the world's sequestration potential?
2. Can we recalibrate old Penman-Monteith based ET models to tropical forest constants rather than grass constants?
3. How do the benefits of nature on health change based on socio-economics?
4. Can S2BAK be applied to Brazil?
