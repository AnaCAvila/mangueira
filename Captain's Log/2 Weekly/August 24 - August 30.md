1 - run the same thing with optim given heinrich's agbd/age/cwd values.
Compare how her binning is done vs mine.
Understand how each cwd value is calculated.

2 - Do the linear model in optim and make sure you get the same answer.

3 - Precipitation and soil type interaction term.
	Could take a look at the different soil types and check if it could be less granular - could we pool different types of soils?
	- from tasks 1 and 2, get a model functioning from age and cwd. Then check the fit within different soil types? and/or region?

Maybe try randomforest within R?

Plot low/med/high within the same plot could be an interesting comparison point.

# August 28 - Monday

I am taking the day to finish my FRQNT application. At this point I just want the damn thing done and behind me.

Starting with research.


# August 25 - Friday

Working at thomson house. Yesterday, should not have left the lab without writing the outcome of the work and future goals.
Figured out that writing new scripts really is the best choice to avoid clutter.

Git branch to make sure the alterations are not changing the original, well-organized branch with everything nice and organized.

Make atomic changes.
