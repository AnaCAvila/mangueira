### Notes
  

Increased  species  richness,  a  higher  proportion  of  nitrogen  fixers  and  species with low LMA  

increased carbon storage in the mixed-species plantation, while a higher proportion of large trees and species with high LMA increased tree carbon storage  in  the  natural  forest. 

Tree  species  varied in their absolute and relative values between natural and planted sites 

In disturbed sites, nitrogen fixers make a big difference. 

Differences in predictions between planted land and natural populations. 

Variation in natural populations is important, and isn’t always achievable from natural forests. 

Functional traits may consider redundancy in some species. 

Leaf mass per area (LMA) is inversely correlated to photosynthetic rates. 

Effect of LMA diversity is less important than effect of max height and N fixer diversity. 

In BCI – the more a canopy tree dominates, the greater the increase in carbon storage (functional dominance). 

No relationship between richness and biomass – BCI is a much richer environment, so it makes sense to have saturated the amount of species that can make a difference. 

Plots with a higher variation in maximum height had less storage than plots with more variation in maximum height. This could be because of age (more variation means younger forests) or because of liana presence, which reduces carbon storage. 

In Sardinilla – increasing species # increased carbon storage. Trees were planted trying to maximize functional diversity. 

Sardinilla is regrowing on pasture, and had less nitrogen load. Nitrogen fixers are facultative - Diversity and presence of nitrogen fixers only increased biomass in mid diversity plots, and makes sense in more disturbed/less N rich plots.
