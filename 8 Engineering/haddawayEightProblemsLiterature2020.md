Eight problems with literature reviews and how to fix them

üîë Keywords

Meta analysisw

Systematic review

ü§î Questions

how to tell if a review is biased?

What does effect size mean?

McGill research librarians can help you find information!

‚òùüèº Main takeaways

1. Lack of relevance (involving the people and companies interested in the project)
2. Lack of a protocol (forgetting initial objectives)
3. Lack of transparency (can't be replicated)
4. Selection bias (including the true breadth of knowledge in the topic)

- include synonyms
- using different tools
- check for site bias; was something done predominately on tropical environments or more on temperate?

6. Publication bias (looking up grey literature)

- grey literature is when reports are not commercially published. sometimes there are negative or nonconclusive results which are less likely to hit journals.

8. Lack of criticism ( not considering whether the studies you are reading do indeed convince you)

- think critically whether the studies you are considered are plausible, and whether they have been criticized by past literature.

10. Inappropriate synthesis

- meta-analysis is the combination of quantitative information from multiple studies - calculation of effect sizes, combined effects, confidence intervals... all to generate one summary estimate of all findings.
- Some studies may not consider different effect sizes and statistical power of different studies.
- Look up criteria for meta-analysis
- Vote-counting when considering different studies with different conclusions over the same topic should NEVER be employed; instead, statistical methods and past critiques of each paper considered in the review must be taken into account.
- If not able to do a meta-analysis, narrative synthesis are preferrable to vote-counting.

12. Not collaborating with others or having work double-checked.

- collaborate with others, and double-check each other's work.

Notes and thoughts

- systematic reviews: supposed to reduce bias, but don't always. Are a more methodic way to review; question, protocol, search for papers, screen papers, take data, criticize, synthesize, and finally review/publish. May do those steps badly, or not do them at all.
- Issue with meta analyses: sometimes the data isn't really shared with reviewers, and a lot of data richness is lost. Mainly if you're doing a meta-analysis with too many studies; and it's important to read meta-analyses with skepticism.
- Be careful with trusting reviews - most of them don't fit the criteria of a systematic review.
- In well-written systematic reviews and meta-analyses you can see themes and trends more easily than by studying the entire field
- Bar-graphs are not a great way to display data - best to have all data points out of specific categories
- Reading past theses for reviews can be a great source of negative information and true data collection.

Model structural uncertainty on carbon cycle projections

Wieder, 2015

Future productivity and carbon storage limited by terrestrial nutrient availability (Wieder et al 2015) shows that N and P limit carbon uptake.

Effects of model structural uncertainty on carbon cycle projections ‚Äì

biological nitrogen fixation as a case study

- What does structural uncertainty mean in this context, and why is it important to consider model structural uncertainties?

- Increased complexity of models brings increased uncertainty

- terrestrial carbon, plant productivity, carbon turnover - all hard to tell

- Adding nitrogen to the models can make models more realistic, but increase their uncertainty. They're closer to reality, but less reliable/accurate......

- Why is it so difficult to accurately represent biological nitrogen fixation in models? What are some of the unknowns associated with BNF?

- not enough empirical measurements
- not enough understanding on its biophysics

- usually use evapotranspiration and net primary production only

- What are the main ways that biological nitrogen fixation is represented in the land- surface models tested in this study?

- NPP driven and evapotranspiration.

- What happened when BNF was represented in different ways? Based on the findings from this study, how much does changing the model representation of BNF matter?

- NPP estimates are 15% higher than ET estimates in general, but higher in ET estimates in arid and tropical (southern hemisphere) environments. Total BNF is higher in the tropics regardless.
- CASA estimated either very high or very low BNF.
- ET estimates of BNF are much lower since more CO2 requires more N and terrestrial N, without NPP, is not able to maintain that supply. Global NPP is expected to decrease and therefore carbon sink also decreases (less forests and algae), meaning less of a carbon sink.

- The authors suggest a few different ways to improve model representation of BNF. Which suggestions do you think are the most promising? Can you think of other research strategies that could reduce structural uncertainty in BNF ‚Äì what questions or unknowns do you think would be the most important to know, measure, or test?

- The model does not represent disturbances
- model-data fusion to improve model certainty

- finding out what parameters best fit the real life observations and quantify their uncertainty
- acquiring more data
- finding where data should be collected and how model can be improved (duh)
