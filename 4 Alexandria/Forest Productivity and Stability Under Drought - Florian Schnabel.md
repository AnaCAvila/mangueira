The significance of tree species richness, structural diversity and functional diversity.

Droughts affect monocultures more strongly
	Monocultures can provide more ecosystem services (such as wood production) #eco_services
	Monocultures have low ecological stability, and low multifunctionality.

BEF - Biodiversity and eco functioning
	Temporal stability - mean vs variance relationship between productivity and BEF relationship

Complementarity causes higher productivity due to resource partitioning, biotic feedbacks, and abiotic facilitation.
Reduced stress and higher productivity can ensue.

Schnabel et al 2021 - Science Advances
	Species asynchrony - in occurrence of different climate conditions, different species dominate, so there is always someone taking advantage of the current climate.

Positive diversity-prodictivity relationships dominate
gamfeldt 2013, forrester and pretzsch 2015, liang 2016

But under drought there's differences.

Diversity-stability relationship is less certain - how does diversity affect productivity under drought?

Carbon isotopic ratio in the roots is a proxy for physiological drought stress. Trees don't like C13, but if it's dry they close stomates and take more of the C that they don't like.

Anderegg 2018 - functional diversity in drought-tolerance traits

Observations in nature can represent the real system better, but sacrifice on comprehensiveness (adding confounding effects) and ortogonality

He looked at the response of climate on growth and traits on C13 (sensitivity to water stress)

In experimental setting, he looked at neighborhood to community level effects of species richness, structural diversity, climate and traits on growth, C13 and stability.

HOW DOES HE MEASURE STABILITY?
- reminder - mean over SD

Worked on a monoculture but also experimental plots with 2-5 tree species in Panama; also, the largest tree diversity experiment in china, with monoculture but also 2,4,8,16 and 24 species.

Drivers of productivity and its temporal stability in a tropical tree diversity experiment - check out the paper!

- Drought has a more negative effect after the second year. Species react differently to drought, so richness acts as insurance.
- 16 year old forests in Panama
	- Diversity increases tree-level productivity.
	- Individual species responded differently to drought
	- Stronger effect in El Nino.
- What could cause some species to have a positive response to drought?

In the Chinese experiment:
- Selection of functional traits was done based on a PCA
	- Resistant vs acquisitive, water saved vs spender
	- Tree growth increased with richness
	- resistant species grow more than resistant species.
	- At the community level, a tree surrounded by acquisitive species grows less when there's drought, as the water spenders take up too much of the water.

Trait-driven responses to drought can explain community stability under drought.

Structural equation models - Community weighed means did not influence stability. Guess it makes sense, as we need variety in the species, but the overall mean won't really make big diferences.
But shouldn't a community weighed mean with more conservative species withstand droughts better?
- over time, with more droughts, conservative species should fare better. Also, faster growing species could be better in droughts, while slower growers are better as recovery.

Diversity effects on stability emerge only at community level, but effects on productivity scale up from neighborhood to community level

Species richness won't always change productivity under drought, but FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY WILL.

Questions
What are the ages of the chinese experiment?
Does the same pattern show in the Panamanian experiment
And what does he think will change with age?

The interactions between the trees may take time to mature, so that can also change over time as they age. - speculates the response may be even higher in older forests.

The responses of the Panamanian forests may not necessarily be related to functional diversity.

Effect on overall biomass may be dependent on species-dependent response to climate.

Would be interesting to look into other tree plantation experiments for future reference.
Stability measure is a coefficient of variation. Which one is driving the change - the mean or the SD?
- SD should be driving stability, which makes sense.

Species asynchrony is the main driver of resistance to drought.

Ash is the dominant species in temperate forests in europe, and due to a fungal infection, 60% of them were lost in the past 5 years

Redundancy in temperate forests may mean there is a reducing return to investment as diversity increases? Wondering if this could be a thing in tropical forests - consider how to incorporate this maybe in chapter 2?
