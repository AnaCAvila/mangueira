TerraClimate uses climatically aided interpolation, combining high-spatial resolution climatological normals from the WorldClim dataset, with coarser resolution time varying (i.e., monthly) data from other sources to produce a monthly dataset of precipitation, maximum and minimum temperature, wind speed, vapor pressure, and solar radiation. TerraClimate additionally produces monthly surface water balance datasets using a water balance model that incorporates reference evapotranspiration, precipitation, temperature, and interpolated plant extractable soil water capacity. These data provide important inputs for ecological and hydrological studies at global scales that require high spatial resolution and time varying climate and climatic water balance data. We validated spatiotemporal aspects of TerraClimate using annual temperature, precipitation, and calculated reference evapotranspiration from station data, as well as annual runoff from streamflow gauges. TerraClimate datasets showed noted improvement in overall mean absolute error and increased spatial realism relative to coarser resolution gridded datasets.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Abatzoglou","given":"John T."},{"family":"Dobrowski","given":"Solomon Z."},{"family":"Parks","given":"Sean A."},{"family":"Hegewisch","given":"Katherine C."}],"citation-key":"abatzoglouTerraClimateHighresolutionGlobal2018","container-title":"Scientific Data","container-title-short":"Sci Data","DOI":"10.1038/sdata.2017.191","ISSN":"2052-4463","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",1,9]]},"language":"en","page":"170191","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"TerraClimate, a high-resolution global dataset of monthly climate and climatic water balance from 1958–2015","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2017191","volume":"5"},

This study examines the relationship between deforestation and malaria cases in the Peruvian Amazon region while addressing spatial interdependence among districts by using a Spatial Durbin Model. Our primary results suggest that the total effect of a decline of 1,000 hectares of forest cover is associated with an additional 69 malaria cases. The spatial model allows us to further determine that both direct and spillover effects are positive. Following the Avoided Cost approach in Barbier et al., we estimate that the cost of the additional malaria cases could approach USD 24.8 million, an amount similar to the recent health program funded by the Peruvian government to combat malaria. Our findings suggest that policy makers should consider the trade-offs between the economic benefits of deforestation and the cost associated with increased malaria incidence.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Aguirre","given":"Julio"},{"family":"Rojas","given":"Pedro"},{"family":"Yu","given":"T.

  {"id":"aideForestRecoveryAbandoned1995","abstract":"The conversion of tropical forests into pastures has increased dramatically in the last 20 years. Once these lands are abandoned it is not clear if they will recover to forest or if they will become permanent grasslands. Economic changes in Puerto Rico have led to the abandonment of agricultural lands over the last 60 years, providing an opportunity to assess the longer term patterns of forest recovery following human disturbance. This study focuses on the changes in vegetation in abandoned pastures ranging in age from 0 to 60 years or more in two replicate chronosequences. Species richness and density of woody species were very low during the first 10 years following abandonment and woody biomass did not increase substantially until approximately 15 years post-abandonment. Recovery in pastures is greatly delayed in comparison with forest recovery following other types of human and natural disturbance. The successional trajectory is quite different in comparison to those following natural disturbances in the nearby Luquillo Mountains.

  {"id":"aideForestRecoveryAbandoned1996","abstract":"A major cause of tropical deforestation has been the conversion of lowland forest into pastures for cattle grazing. We studied forest structure and species composition following abandonment of cattle pastures in 23 abandoned pastures 9.5-60 yr old and seven forested sites > 60 yr old. Sites were chosen along an elevational gradient from 10-450 m and represented subtropical wet and moist forest life zones. Age since abandonment was the best predictor of stand characteristics. Woody plant density, basal area, species number, and diversity were low 10 yr after abandonment, but increased rapidly after 10 to 15 yr post-abandonment. Although distance to nearest seed source and hurricane exposure are factors that could affect forest recovery, there was little variation among sites and no effects were detected. Elevation and age were significant determinants of species composition. At higher elevations (> 100 m), the shrub Miconia prasina (Melastomataceae) was the dominant pioneer species, but in the low elevation, a larger group of shrubs and small trees colonized abandoned pastures. At higher elevations, the species composition of recovering sites did not include many mature forest species. After 40 yr of recovery, secondary forest stands cannot be distinguished from undisturbed sites in terms of density, basal area, species number, or diversity, but it appears that it will require centuries for these sites to return to a species composition similar to undisturbed forests.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Aide","given":"T.

The Amazon is the most species-rich subcontinental-scale ecosystem and is home to more than 10% of all named plant and vertebrate species, concentrated into just 0.5% of Earth’s surface area. The Amazon rainforest is also a critical component of the Earth climate system, contributing about 16% of all terrestrial photosynthetic productivity and strongly regulating global carbon and water cycles.\n              Amazonian ecosystems are being rapidly degraded by human industrial activities. A cumulative total of 17% of the original forest have already been cleared, and 14% replaced, by agricultural land use. After millions of years serving as an immense global carbon pool, under further warming the Amazon rainforest is predicted to become a net carbon source to the atmosphere. Some regions have already made the transition, with forest respiration and burning outpacing forest photosynthesis.\n            \n            \n              ADVANCES\n              In this Review, we compare rates of anthropogenic and natural environmental changes in the Amazon and South America and in the larger Earth system. We focus on deforestation and carbon cycles because of their critical roles on the Amazon and Earth systems. Data for South America were compiled for the Science Panel for the Amazon (SPA) Assessment Report, which details the many dimensions of the Amazon as a regional entity of the Earth system. The SPA report, coauthored by 240 scientists from 20 countries, documents epoch-scale transformations in Amazonian biodiversity, ecosystem function, and cultural diversity.\n              We found that rates of anthropogenic processes that affect Amazonian ecosystems are up to hundreds to thousands of times faster than other natural climatic and geological phenomena. These anthropogenic changes reach the scale of millions of square kilometers within just decades to centuries, as compared with millions to tens of millions of years for evolutionary, climatic, and geological processes. The main drivers of Amazonian habitat destruction and degradation are land-use changes (such as land clearing, wildfires, and soil erosion), water-use changes (such as damming and fragmenting rivers and increased sedimentation from deforestation), and aridification from global climate change. Additional important threats come from overhunting and overfishing, introduction of invasive exotic species, and pollution from the mining of minerals and hydrocarbons.\n            \n            \n              OUTLOOK\n              Given the outsized role of the Amazon in our planetary hydrological cycle, large-scale deforestation of this region is expected to push the whole Earth system across a critical threshold to a qualitatively different global climate regime. Quite aside from biodiversity losses, such a transformation will have multifarious and catastrophic consequences for human welfare, including widespread water and food insecurity that will lead to mass migrations and political instability. The key message is that Amazonian environments are being degraded by human industrial activities at a pace far above anything previously known, imperiling its vast biodiversity reserves and globally important ecosystem services.\n              The Amazon is now perched to transition rapidly from a largely forested to a nonforested landscape, and the changes are happening much too rapidly for Amazonian species, peoples, and ecosystems to respond adaptively. Policies to prevent the worst outcomes are known and must be enacted immediately. We now need political will and leadership to act on this information.

  {"id":"allenModelingCarbonCost2020","abstract":"Nutrient limitation is a key source of uncertainty in predicting terrestrial carbon (C) uptake. Models have begun to include nitrogen (N) dynamics; however, phosphorus (P), which can also limit or colimit net primary production in many ecosystems, is currently absent in most models. To meet this challenge, we integrated P dynamics into a cutting-edge plant nutrient uptake model (Fixation and Uptake of Nitrogen: FUN 2.0) that mechanistically tracks the C cost of N uptake from soil based on the cost of allocating C to leaf resorption and root/root-microbial uptake and the availability of N in soil. We incorporated the direct C cost of P uptake, as well as an N cost of synthesizing phosphatase enzymes to extract P from soil, into a new model formulation (FUN 3.0). We confronted and validated FUN 3.0 against empirical estimates of canopy, root, and soil P pools from 45 temperate forest plots in Indiana, USA, and 18 tropical dry forest plots located in Guanacaste, Costa Rica, that vary in P availability and distribution of arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal associated trees. FUN 3.0 was able to accurately predict N and P retranslocation across the temperate and tropical forest sites (slopes of 0.95 and 0.92 for P and N retranslocation, respectively). Carbon costs for acquiring P were three times higher in tropical forest sites compared to temperate forest sites, driving overall higher C costs in tropical sites. In addition, the N costs for acquiring P in tropical forest sites lead to a substantial increase in N fixation to support phosphatase enzyme production. Sensitivity analyses showed that tropical sites appeared to be severely P limited, while the temperate sites showed evidence for co-limitation by N and P. Collectively, FUN 3.0 provides a novel framework for predicting coupled N and P limitation that earth system models can leverage to enhance predictions of ecosystem response to global change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Allen","given":"Kara"},{"family":"Fisher","given":"Joshua B."},{"family":"Phillips","given":"Richard P."},{"family":"Powers","given":"Jennifer S."},{"family":"Brzostek","given":"Edward R."}],"citation-key":"allenModelingCarbonCost2020","container-title":"Frontiers in Forests and Global Change","ISSN":"2624-893X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"source":"Frontiers","title":"Modeling the Carbon Cost of Plant Nitrogen and Phosphorus Uptake Across Temperate and Tropical Forests","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/ffgc.2020.00043","volume":"3"},

  {"id":"andereggHydraulicDiversityForests2018","abstract":"Plants influence the atmosphere through fluxes of carbon, water and energy1, and can intensify drought through land–atmosphere feedback effects2–4. The diversity of plant functional traits in forests, especially physiological traits related to water (hydraulic) transport, may have a critical role in land–atmosphere feedback, particularly during drought. Here we combine 352 site-years of eddy covariance measurements from 40 forest sites, remote-sensing observations of plant water content and plant functional-trait data to test whether the diversity in plant traits affects the response of the ecosystem to drought. We find evidence that higher hydraulic diversity buffers variation in ecosystem flux during dry periods across temperate and boreal forests. Hydraulic traits were the predominant significant predictors of cross-site patterns in drought response. By contrast, standard leaf and wood traits, such as specific leaf area and wood density, had little explanatory power. Our results demonstrate that diversity in the hydraulic traits of trees mediates ecosystem resilience to drought and is likely to have an important role in future ecosystem–atmosphere feedback effects in a changing climate.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Anderegg","given":"William R.

  {"id":"andereggRepresentingPlantDiversity2021","abstract":"Plants are critical mediators of terrestrial mass and energy fluxes, and their structural and functional traits have profound impacts on local and global climate, biogeochemistry, biodiversity, and hydrology. Yet Earth System Models (ESMs), our most powerful tools for predicting the effects of humans on the coupled biosphere-atmosphere system, simplify the incredible diversity of land plants into a handful of coarse categories of ‘Plant Functional Types’ (PFTs) that often fail to capture ecological dynamics such as biome distributions. The inclusion of more realistic functional diversity is a recognized goal for ESMs, yet there is currently no consistent, widely accepted way to add diversity to models, i.e. to determine what new PFTs to add and with what data to constrain their parameters. We review approaches to representing plant diversity in ESMs and draw on recent ecological and evolutionary findings to present an evolution-based functional type approach for further disaggregating functional diversity. Specifically, the prevalence of niche conservatism, or the tendency of closely related taxa to retain similar ecological and functional attributes through evolutionary time, reveals that evolutionary relatedness is a powerful framework for summarizing functional similarities and differences among plant types. We advocate that Plant Functional Types based on dominant evolutionary lineages (‘Lineage Functional Types’) will provide an ecologically defensible, tractable, and scalable framework for representing plant diversity in next-generation ESMs, with the potential to improve parameterization, process representation, and model benchmarking. We highlight how the importance of evolutionary history for plant function can unify the work of disparate fields to improve predictive modeling of the Earth system.","author":[{"family":"Anderegg","given":"Leander D.

  {"id":"andersenSeedlingPerformanceTradeoffs2014","abstract":"Recent studies have provided evidence that trade-offs in biomass allocation, resource-use efficiency, and anti-herbivore defense influence seedling performance and distribution across soil types. Our previous research suggested that soil nutrient availability acted as a filter for understory palm community assembly and species coexistence in a lower montane forest in western Panama. Here, we experimentally tested three potential mechanisms that could be driving this filtering of palm communities along a soil nutrient gradient. We examined seedling performance of 13 understory palm taxa with differing distribution patterns transplanted to five sites, where they were both exposed to and protected from herbivores. We found the strongest evidence for habitat filtering at the lowest-nutrient site, where seedlings of locally occurring species had significant performance advantages over those of locally absent species, regardless of protection from herbivores. When transplanted to the lowest-nutrient site, seedlings of naturally occurring species maintained high above- to belowground biomass ratios, maximized photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency, and minimized leaf area loss to herbivores and pathogens. Species from low-fertility sites were therefore able to maintain higher survival and relative growth rates (RGR) at the lowest-nutrient site than species from more fertile sites. Similar patterns were found for a high-nutrient site, where naturally occurring species had higher RGR compared to species from lower-fertility sites. However, the functional traits associated with the differences in performance at high-nutrient sites were less clear, perhaps due to increased light limitation in the understory of these sites. At higher-nutrient sites, protection from herbivores significantly reduced leaf area damage and mortality rates in seedlings, particularly for naturally occurring species. Overall, morphological and physiological traits were more strongly coupled with soil nutrient availability than were leaf damage or seedling performance across the sites. Nonetheless, the coordination of all three trade-offs was related to the strongest performance advantage and, therefore, ecological filtering along the soil nutrient gradient in this lower montane forest.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Andersen","given":"Kelly M."},{"family":"Turner","given":"Benjamin L."},{"family":"Dalling","given":"James W."}],"citation-key":"andersenSeedlingPerformanceTradeoffs2014","container-title":"Ecology","DOI":"10.1890/13-1688.1","ISSN":"1939-9170","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2014 by the Ecological Society of America","page":"3399-3413","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Seedling performance trade-offs influencing habitat filtering along a soil nutrient gradient in a tropical forest","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/13-1688.1","volume":"95"},
  {"id":"anderson-teixeiraCarbonCyclingMature2021","abstract":"Forests are major components of the global carbon (C) cycle and thereby strongly influence atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and climate. However, efforts to incorporate forests into climate models and CO2 accounting frameworks have been constrained by a lack of accessible, global-scale synthesis on how C cycling varies across forest types and stand ages. Here, we draw from the Global Forest Carbon Database, ForC, to provide a macroscopic overview of C cycling in the world’s forests, giving special attention to stand age-related variation. Specifically, we use 11 923 ForC records for 34 C cycle variables from 865 geographic locations to characterize ensemble C budgets for four broad forest types—tropical broadleaf evergreen, temperate broadleaf, temperate conifer, and boreal. We calculate means and standard deviations for both mature and regrowth (age < 100 years) forests and quantify trends with stand age in regrowth forests for all variables with sufficient data. C cycling rates generally decreased from tropical to temperate to boreal in both mature and regrowth forests, whereas C stocks showed less directional variation. Mature forest net ecosystem production did not differ significantly among biomes. The majority of flux variables, together with most live biomass pools, increased significantly with the logarithm of stand age. As climate change accelerates, understanding and managing the carbon dynamics of forests is critical to forecasting, mitigation, and adaptation. This comprehensive and synthetic global overview of C stocks and fluxes across biomes and stand ages contributes to these efforts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Anderson-Teixeira","given":"Kristina J"},{"family":"Herrmann","given":"Valentine"},{"family":"Banbury Morgan","given":"Rebecca"},{"family":"Bond-Lamberty","given":"Ben"},{"family":"Cook-Patton","given":"Susan C"},{"family":"Ferson","given":"Abigail E"},{"family":"Muller-Landau","given":"Helene C"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Maria M H"}],"citation-key":"anderson-teixeiraCarbonCyclingMature2021","container-title":"Environmental Research Letters","container-title-short":"Environ.

  {"id":"andersonBiomeScaleForestProperties2012","abstract":"Amazonian forests are extremely heterogeneous at different spatial scales. This review intends to present the large-scale patterns of the ecosystem properties of Amazonia, and focuses on two parts of the main components of the net primary production: the long-lived carbon pools (wood) and short-lived pools (leaves). First, the focus is on forest biophysical properties, and secondly, on the macro-scale leaf phenological patterns of these forests, looking at field measurements and bringing into discussion the recent findings derived from remote sensing dataset. Finally, I discuss the results of the three major droughts that hit Amazonia in the last 15 years. The panorama that emerges from this review suggests that slow growing forests in central and eastern Amazonia, where soils are poorer, have significantly higher above ground biomass and higher wood density, trees are higher and present lower proportions of large-leaved species than stands in northwest and southwest Amazonia. However, the opposite pattern is observed in relation to forest productivity and dynamism, which is higher in western Amazonia than in central and eastern forests. The spatial patterns on leaf phenology across Amazonia are less marked. Field data from different forest formations showed that new leaf production can be unrelated to climate seasonality, timed with radiation, timed with rainfall and/or river levels. Oppositely, satellite images exhibited a large-scale synchronized peak in new leaf production during the dry season. Satellite data and field measurements bring contrasting results for the 2005 drought. Discussions on data processing and filtering, aerosols effects and a combined analysis with field and satellite images are presented. It is suggested that to improve the understanding of the large-scale patterns on Amazonian forests, integrative analyses that combine new technologies in remote sensing and long-term field ecological data are imperative.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Anderson","given":"Liana O."}],"citation-key":"andersonBiomeScaleForestProperties2012","container-title":"Remote Sensing","DOI":"10.3390/rs4051245","ISSN":"2072-4292","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",5]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"5","page":"1245-1271","publisher":"Molecular Diversity Preservation International","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Biome-Scale Forest Properties in Amazonia Based on Field and Satellite Observations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/4/5/1245","volume":"4"},

Here, we present a model that predicts the temperature dependence of the biomass accumulation rate following disturbances in forests. Model predictions are derived based on allometric and biochemical principles that govern plant energetics and are tested using a global database of 91 studies of secondary succession compiled from the literature. The rate of biomass accumulation during secondary succession increases with average growing season temperature as predicted based on the biochemical kinetics of photosynthesis in chloroplasts. In addition, the rate of biomass accumulation is greater in angiosperm-dominated communities than in gymnosperm-dominated ones and greater in plantations than in naturally regenerating stands. By linking the temperature-dependence of photosynthesis to the rate of whole-ecosystem biomass accumulation during secondary succession, our model and results provide one example of how emergent, ecosystem-level rate processes can be predicted based on the kinetics of individual metabolic rate.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Anderson","given":"Kristina J."},{"family":"Allen","given":"Andrew P."},{"family":"Gillooly","given":"James F."},{"family":"Brown","given":"James H."}],"citation-key":"andersonTemperaturedependenceBiomassAccumulation2006","container-title":"Ecology Letters","container-title-short":"Ecol Letters","DOI":"10.1111/j.1461-0248.2006.00914.x","ISSN":"1461-023X, 1461-0248","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",6]]},"language":"en","page":"673-682","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Temperature-dependence of biomass accumulation rates during secondary succession","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2006.00914.x","volume":"9"},

It is now clear that different regions and taxonomic groups have responded differently to geological and climatic changes. However, we still lack a basic understanding of how Neotropical biodiversity was assembled over evolutionary timescales. Here we infer the timing and origin of the living biota in all major Neotropical regions by performing a cross-taxonomic biogeographic analysis based on 4,450 species from six major clades across the tree of life (angiosperms, birds, ferns, frogs, mammals, and squamates), and integrate >1.3 million species occurrences with large-scale phylogenies. We report an unprecedented level of biotic interchange among all Neotropical regions, totaling 4,525 dispersal events. About half of these events involved transitions between major environmental types, with a predominant directionality from forested to open biomes. For all taxonomic groups surveyed here, Amazonia is the primary source of Neotropical diversity, providing >2,800 lineages to other regions. Most of these dispersal events were to Mesoamerica (∼1,500 lineages), followed by dispersals into open regions of northern South America and the Cerrado and Chaco biomes. Biotic interchange has taken place for >60 million years and generally increased toward the present. The total amount of time lineages spend in a region appears to be the strongest predictor of migration events. These results demonstrate the complex origin of tropical ecosystems and the key role of biotic interchange for the assembly of regional biotas.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Antonelli","given":"Alexandre"},{"family":"Zizka","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Carvalho","given":"Fernanda Antunes"},{"family":"Scharn","given":"Ruud"},{"family":"Bacon","given":"Christine D."},{"family":"Silvestro","given":"Daniele"},{"family":"Condamine","given":"Fabien L."}],"citation-key":"antonelliAmazoniaPrimarySource2018","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1713819115","issue":"23","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",6,5]]},"page":"6034-6039","publisher":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","source":"www-pnas-org.proxy3.library.mcgill.ca (Atypon)","title":"Amazonia is the primary source of Neotropical biodiversity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1713819115","volume":"115"},

We now understand that many tropical forests persist despite historical legacies of human occupation and management (Bush and Colinvaux, 1994; Piperno, 2007; Denham et al., 2009) and they are resilient to a range of natural and human large-scale disturbances (Lugo, 1995; Gómez-Pompa and Kaus, 1999; Lugo et al., 2002; Chazdon, 2003). We also now know that the high species richness and heterogeneity of tropical forests cannot be attributed to the long-term climatic stability of these ecosystems (Colinvaux, 1987; Bush and Colinvaux, 1990), but are emergent properties of species adaptations, interspecific interactions, coevolution and feedbacks among ecological processes at multiple levels.","author":[{"family":"Arroyo","given":"Robin L.

Traditional modeling and remote-sensing approaches are not well suited to tropical forest studies, because (i) biophysical mechanisms determining drought effects on canopy water and carbon dynamics are poorly known, and (ii) remote-sensing metrics of canopy greenness may be insensitive to small changes in leaf area accompanying drought. New spaceborne imaging spectroscopy may detect drought stress in tropical forests, helping to monitor forest physiology and constrain carbon models. We combined a forest drought experiment in Amazônia with spaceborne imaging spectrometer measurements of this area. With field data on rainfall, soil water, and leaf and canopy responses, we tested whether spaceborne hyperspectral observations quantify differences in canopy water and NPP resulting from drought stress. We found that hyperspectral metrics of canopy water content and light-use efficiency are highly sensitive to drought.

However, carbon inventories based on field plots alone cannot capture the heterogeneity of carbon stocks, and thus remote sensing-assisted approaches are critically important to carbon mapping at regional to global scales. We advanced a high-resolution, national-scale carbon mapping approach applied to the Republic of Panama – one of the first UN REDD + partner countries.\nResults: Integrating measurements of vegetation structure collected by airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) with field inventory plots, we report LiDAR-estimated aboveground carbon stock errors of ~10% on any 1-ha land parcel across a wide range of ecological conditions. Critically, this shows that LiDAR provides a highly reliable replacement for inventory plots in areas lacking field data, both in humid tropical forests and among drier tropical vegetation types. We then scale up a systematically aligned LiDAR sampling of Panama using satellite data on topography, rainfall, and vegetation cover to model carbon stocks at 1-ha resolution with estimated average pixel-level uncertainty of 20.5 Mg C ha-1 nationwide.\nConclusions: The national carbon map revealed strong abiotic and human controls over Panamanian carbon stocks, and the new level of detail with estimated uncertainties for every individual hectare in the country sets Panama at the forefront in high-resolution ecosystem management.

As a result, assessing soil physicochemical properties and subsequent implications on soil fertility is essential for understanding the influence of agro-ecosystem revolution on agricultural soil quality and efficiency. In this research, we assessed the effect of land-use management practices on selected soil properties under varying terrain slopes and with and without soil conservation measures in a highly disturbed landscape in the northern part of Ethiopia in 2016. Based on the result, for all slope positions considered—namely, lower (1%-15%), middle (15%-30%), and upper (30%-45% and above)—with and without soil conservation, soil moisture content, porosity, silt, and clay proportions were lower in the cultivated land compared with grazing and forestland-use units. Conversely, soil bulk density and the sand fraction were higher in the cultivated land than grazing and forestland units, relatively. Observing changes in a terrain slope position, sand content of forest, grazing, and cultivated land units increased from lower to upper slope position whereas silt and clay fraction generally showed a decreasing trend from lower to an upper slope positions. In all slope positions with and without conservation practice, cation exchange capacity, exchangeable K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ showed a significant increase from cultivated land to grazing and then forestland. The mean value of pH and electrical conductivity of cultivated lands with and without soil conservation were significantly low in all slope categories. Summarizing the analysis of variance for selected soil chemical properties with different slope positions, except available phosphorous, all chemical properties considered in this study are statistically significant (P < .05). In summary, the result confirmed that soil properties were strongly influenced by terrain slope, land use, and changes in management practice. Consequently, to conserve soil resources, policymakers need to implement appropriate land conservation strategies based on land-use structure and slope variation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Assefa","given":"Fikru"},{"family":"Elias","given":"Eyasu"},{"family":"Soromessa","given":"Teshome"},{"family":"Ayele","given":"Gebiaw T"}],"citation-key":"assefaEffectChangesLandUse2020","container-title":"Air, Soil and Water Research","container-title-short":"Air, Soil and Water Research","DOI":"10.1177/1178622120939587","ISSN":"1178-6221, 1178-6221","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",1]]},"language":"en","page":"117862212093958","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Effect of Changes in Land-Use Management Practices on Soil Physicochemical Properties in Kabe Watershed, Ethiopia","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1178622120939587","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"bakerEvapotranspirationAmazonSpatial2021","abstract":"Water recycled through transpiring forests influences the spatial distribution of precipitation in the Amazon and has been shown to play a role in the initiation of the wet season. However, due to the challenges and costs associated with measuring evapotranspiration (ET) directly and high uncertainty in remote-sensing ET retrievals, the spatial and temporal patterns in Amazon ET remain poorly understood. In this study, we estimated ET over the Amazon and 10 sub-basins using a catchment-balance approach, whereby ET is calculated directly as the balance between precipitation, runoff, and change in groundwater storage. We compared our results with ET from remote-sensing datasets, reanalysis, models from Phase 5 and Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Projects (CMIP5 and CMIP6 respectively), and in situ flux tower measurements to provide a comprehensive overview of current understanding. Catchment-balance analysis revealed a gradient in ET from east to west/southwest across the Amazon Basin, a strong seasonal cycle in basin-mean ET primarily controlled by net incoming radiation, and no trend in ET over the past 2 decades. This approach has a degree of uncertainty, due to errors in each of the terms of the water budget; therefore, we conducted an error analysis to identify the range of likely values. Satellite datasets, reanalysis, and climate models all tended to overestimate the magnitude of ET relative to catchment-balance estimates, underestimate seasonal and interannual variability, and show conflicting positive and negative trends. Only two out of six satellite and model datasets analysed reproduced spatial and seasonal variation in Amazon ET, and captured the same controls on ET as indicated by catchment-balance analysis. CMIP5 and CMIP6 ET was inconsistent with catchment-balance estimates over all scales analysed. Overall, the discrepancies between data products and models revealed by our analysis demonstrate a need for more ground-based ET measurements in the Amazon as well as a need to substantially improve model representation of this fundamental component of the Amazon hydrological cycle.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Baker","given":"Jessica C.

Secondary forests provide important potential for conservation of biodiversity and climate change mitigation. In this paper, we explore whether collective property rights in the form of indigenous territories (ITs) lead to higher rates of secondary forest growth in previously deforested areas. We exploit the timing of granting of property rights, the geographic boundaries of ITs and two different methods, regression discontinuity design and difference-in-difference, to recover causal estimates. We find strong evidence that indigenous territories with secure tenure not only reduce deforestation inside their lands but also lead to higher secondary forest growth on previously deforested areas. After receiving full property rights, land inside ITs displayed higher secondary forest growth than land outside ITs, with an estimated effect of 5% using our main RDD specification, and 2.21% using our difference-in-difference research design. Furthermore, we estimate that the average age of secondary forests was 2.2 y older inside ITs with secure tenure using our main RDD specification, and 2.8 y older when using our difference-in-difference research design. Together, these findings provide evidence for the role that collective property rights can play in the push to restore forest ecosystems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Baragwanath","given":"Kathryn"},{"family":"Bayi","given":"Ella"},{"family":"Shinde","given":"Nilesh"}],"citation-key":"baragwanathCollectivePropertyRights2023","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.2221346120","issue":"22","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,30]]},"page":"e2221346120","publisher":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","source":"pnas.org (Atypon)","title":"Collective property rights lead to secondary forest growth in the Brazilian Amazon","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2221346120","volume":"120"},

Forest succession is comprised of continuous structural changes over time and results in increases in aboveground biomass (AGB). New remote sensing methods, including sensors, image processing, statistical methods, and uncertainty evaluations, are constantly being developed to estimate biophysical forest changes. We review 318 peer-reviewed studies related to the use of remotely sensed AGB estimations in tropical forest succession studies and summarize their geographic distribution, sensors and methods used, and their most frequent ecological inferences. Remotely sensed AGB is broadly used in forest management studies, conservation status evaluations, carbon source and sink investigations, and for studies of the relationships between environmental conditions and forest structure. Uncertainties in AGB estimations were found to be heterogeneous with biases related to sensor type, processing methodology, ground truthing availability, and forest characteristics. Remotely sensed AGB of successional forests is more reliable for the study of spatial patterns of forest succession and over large time scales than that of individual stands. Remote sensing of temporal patterns in biomass requires further study, in particular, as it is critical for understanding forest regrowth at scales useful for regional or global analyses.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Barbosa","given":"J.

  {"id":"barlowQuantifyingBiodiversityValue2007","abstract":"Biodiversity loss from deforestation may be partly offset by the expansion of secondary forests and plantation forestry in the tropics. However, our current knowledge of the value of these habitats for biodiversity conservation is limited to very few taxa, and many studies are severely confounded by methodological shortcomings. We examined the conservation value of tropical primary, secondary, and plantation forests for 15 taxonomic groups using a robust and replicated sample design that minimized edge effects. Different taxa varied markedly in their response to patterns of land use in terms of species richness and the percentage of species restricted to primary forest (varying from 5% to 57%), yet almost all between-forest comparisons showed marked differences in community structure and composition. Cross-taxon congruence in response patterns was very weak when evaluated using abundance or species richness data, but much stronger when using metrics based upon community similarity. Our results show that, whereas the biodiversity indicator group concept may hold some validity for several taxa that are frequently sampled (such as birds and fruit-feeding butterflies), it fails for those exhibiting highly idiosyncratic responses to tropical land-use change (including highly vagile species groups such as bats and orchid bees), highlighting the problems associated with quantifying the biodiversity value of anthropogenic habitats. Finally, although we show that areas of native regeneration and exotic tree plantations can provide complementary conservation services, we also provide clear empirical evidence demonstrating the irreplaceable value of primary forests.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Barlow","given":"J."},{"family":"Gardner","given":"T.

  {"id":"barretoWhenForestLoss2023","abstract":"Decades of research indicate that while native habitat loss often drives biodiversity loss and biotic homogeni­ zation, there are frequent exceptions. Relying on a multi-level landscape design, multiple biodiversity metrics and species habitat associations we explored one such exception. We investigated dung beetle responses to Atlantic Forest loss by modeling for both specialist and generalist species abundance, alpha and gamma di­ versities, and beta diversity through a null-model approach (βRC) that permits comparing observed values to those expected by chance. We found that both native forest specialist and habitat generalist communities gained species with native forest loss at local (ᾱ-diversity) and landscape (γ-diversity) levels, while community composition became increasingly dissimilar (β-diversity). Yet, abundance response to forest loss varied between groups. While for generalists, forest loss led to increased overall abundance and abundance distribution across species remained random among communities, for specialists, overall abundance did not change and abundance distribution across species became dissimilar. Such findings suggest that habitat loss does not always drive a decrease in the number of specialist species that compensate for the gain of generalist species, adding to evidence that habitat loss can drive biodiversity gain and biotic differentiation. These responses may be common in particular biogeographical contexts, where contemporary and/or historical regional dynamics may have influ­ enced the resilience of forest biota and contribute to the availability of disturbance-adapted species. Our study highlights the importance of sampling across multiple spatial scales to understand the effects of habitat loss on biodiversity and suggest caution to silver-bullet conservation guidelines.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Barreto","given":"Julia Rodrigues"},{"family":"Pardini","given":"Renata"},{"family":"Metzger","given":"Jean Paul"},{"family":"Silva","given":"Fernando Augusto Barbosa"},{"family":"Nichols","given":"Elizabeth S."}],"citation-key":"barretoWhenForestLoss2023","container-title":"Biological Conservation","container-title-short":"Biological Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/j.biocon.2023.109957","ISSN":"00063207","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",3]]},"language":"en","page":"109957","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"When forest loss leads to biodiversity gain: Insights from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest","title-short":"When forest loss leads to biodiversity gain","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006320723000575","volume":"279"},

  {"id":"bassoAtmosphericCO2Inversion2023","abstract":"Tropical forests such as the Amazonian rainforests play an important role for climate, are large carbon stores and are a treasure of biodiversity. Amazonian forests have been exposed to large-scale deforestation and degradation for many decades. Deforestation declined between 2005 and 2012 but more recently has again increased with similar rates as in 2007–2008. The resulting forest fragments are exposed to substantially elevated temperatures in an already warming world. These temperature and land cover changes are expected to affect the forests, and an important diagnostic of their health and sensitivity to climate variation is their carbon balance. In a recent study based on CO2 atmospheric vertical profile observations between 2010 and 2018, and an air column budgeting technique used to estimate fluxes, we reported the Amazon region as a carbon source to the atmosphere, mainly due to fire emissions. Instead of an air column budgeting technique, we use an inverse of the global atmospheric transport model, TOMCAT, to assimilate CO2 observations from Amazon vertical profiles and global flask measurements. We thus estimate inter- and intra-annual variability in the carbon fluxes, trends over time and controls for the period of 2010–2018. This is the longest period covered by a Bayesian inversion of these atmospheric CO2 profile observations to date. Our analyses indicate that the Amazon is a small net source of carbon to the atmosphere (mean 2010–2018 = 0.13 ± 0.17 Pg C yr−1, where 0.17 is the 1σ uncertainty), with the majority of the emissions coming from the eastern region (77 % of total Amazon emissions). Fire is the primary driver of the Amazonian source (0.26 ± 0.13 Pg C yr−1), while forest carbon uptake removes around half of the fire emissions to the atmosphere (−0.13 ± 0.20 Pg C yr−1). The largest net carbon sink was observed in the western-central Amazon region (72 % of the fire emissions). We find larger carbon emissions during the extreme drought years (such as 2010, 2015 and 2016), correlated with increases in temperature, cumulative water deficit and burned area. Despite the increase in total carbon emissions during drought years, we do not observe a significant trend over time in our carbon total, fire and net biome exchange estimates between 2010 and 2018. Our analysis thus cannot provide clear evidence for a weakening of the carbon uptake by Amazonian tropical forests.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Basso","given":"Luana S."},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Chris"},{"family":"Chipperfield","given":"Martyn P."},{"family":"Tejada","given":"Graciela"},{"family":"Cassol","given":"Henrique L.

  {"id":"baumanTropicalTreeGrowth2022","abstract":"A better understanding of how climate affects growth in tree species is essential for improved predictions of forest dynamics under climate change. Long-term climate averages (mean climate) drive spatial variations in species’ baseline growth rates, whereas deviations from these averages over time (anomalies) can create growth variation around the local baseline. However, the rarity of long-term tree census data spanning climatic gradients has so far limited our understanding of their respective role, especially in tropical systems. Furthermore, tree growth sensitivity to climate is likely to vary widely among species, and the ecological strategies underlying these differences remain poorly understood. Here, we utilize an exceptional dataset of 49 years of growth data for 509 tree species across 23 tropical rainforest plots along a climatic gradient to examine how multiannual tree growth responds to both climate means and anomalies, and how species’ functional traits mediate these growth responses to climate. We show that anomalous increases in atmospheric evaporative demand and solar radiation consistently reduced tree growth. Drier forests and fast-growing species were more sensitive to water stress anomalies. In addition, species traits related to water use and photosynthesis partly explained differences in growth sensitivity to both climate means and anomalies. Our study demonstrates that both climate means and anomalies shape tree growth in tropical forests and that species traits can provide insights into understanding these demographic responses to climate change, offering a promising way forward to forecast tropical forest dynamics under different climate trajectories.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Bauman","given":"David"},{"family":"Fortunel","given":"Claire"},{"family":"Cernusak","given":"Lucas A."},{"family":"Bentley","given":"Lisa P."},{"family":"McMahon","given":"Sean M."},{"family":"Rifai","given":"Sami W."},{"family":"Aguirre-Gutiérrez","given":"Jesús"},{"family":"Oliveras","given":"Imma"},{"family":"Bradford","given":"Matt"},{"family":"Laurance","given":"Susan G.

However, the country also boasts conservation programmes that are among the most robust in the neotropics. Consequently, gradients of anthropogenic to intact ecosystems are found throughout the country. Forest ecosystems may decrease vector-borne disease (VBD) risk by maintaining insect populations in a state of relative equilibrium; however, evidence suggests that intact forests foster biodiversity and may also amplify VBD risk in some circumstances. As a result, focal points of human-vector contact are likely idiosyncratic. This may be particularly true in indigenous territories, which have been shown to play a vital role in maintaining the ecological integrity of conservation areas.

  {"id":"becknellLandscapeScaleLidar2018","abstract":"Secondary forests account for more than half of tropical forests and represent a growing carbon sink, but rates of biomass accumulation vary by a factor of two or more even among plots in the same landscape. To better understand the drivers of this variability, we used airborne lidar to measure forest canopy height and estimate biomass over 4529 ha at Serra do Conduru Park in Southern Bahia, Brazil. We measured trees in 30 georeferenced field plots (0.25-ha each) to estimate biomass using allometry. Then we estimated aboveground biomass density (ABD) across the lidar study area using a statistical model developed from our field plots. This model related the 95th percentile of the distribution of lidar return heights to ABD. We overlaid this map of ABD on a Landsat-derived forest age map to determine rates of biomass accumulation. We found rapid initial biomass regeneration (~6 Mg/ha yr), which slowed as forests aged. We also observed high variability in both height and biomass across the landscape within forests of similar age. Nevertheless, a regression model that accounted for spatial autocorrelation and included forest age, slope, and distance to roads or open areas explained 62 and 77 percent of the landscape variation in ABD and canopy height, respectively. Thus, while there is high spatial heterogeneity in forest recovery, and the drivers of this heterogeneity warrant further investigation, we suggest that a relatively simple set of predictor variables is sufficient to explain the majority of variance in both height and ABD in this landscape.","author":[{"family":"Becknell","given":"Justin M."},{"family":"Keller","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Piotto","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Longo","given":"Marcos"},{"family":"Nara dos-Santos","given":"Maiza"},{"family":"Scaranello","given":"Marcos A."},{"family":"Bruno de Oliveira Cavalcante","given":"Rodrigo"},{"family":"Porder","given":"Stephen"}],"citation-key":"becknellLandscapeScaleLidar2018","container-title":"Biotropica","DOI":"10.1111/btp.12538","ISSN":"0006-3606","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",5]]},"page":"520-530","title":"Landscape‐scale lidar analysis of aboveground biomass distribution in secondary Brazilian Atlantic Forest","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/btp.12538","volume":"50"},

  {"id":"berenguerSeeingWoodsSaplings2018","abstract":"Most of the world's remaining tropical forests have been affected by either selective logging, understorey fires, fragmentation or are regrowing in areas that were previously deforested. Despite the ubiquity of these human-modified forests, we have a limited knowledge of their potential to recover key traits linked to ecosystem processes and consequent services. Here we present data from 31,095 trees and saplings distributed across 121 plots of undisturbed and disturbed primary forests as well as secondary forests in the eastern Amazon. We examined the post-disturbance recovery trajectory of an important plant functional trait, wood density. We tested whether human-modified Amazonian forests are experiencing a rapid or a slow, or even impeded, recovery of this trait, which is associated with the provision of a fundamental ecosystem service—carbon storage. As expected, we found that the plot-level wood density of trees and saplings in disturbed primary and secondary forests was significantly lower than in undisturbed forests. However, there was no significant difference in the average wood density of saplings between disturbed primary and secondary forests, possibly indicating a process of secondarization. We also found evidence that the recovery of wood density in human-modified forests is being severely disrupted due to edge effects (in the case of disturbed primary forests) and high liana densities (in the case of both disturbed primary and secondary forests). Surprisingly, these two factors were more important predictors of wood density recovery than the time elapsed since the disturbance event. Synthesis. Plant communities in human-modified Amazonian forests appear to not be recovering a key functional property—wood density, which in turn may affect their ability to store carbon in the future. If the aim of conservation programs in tropical forests is to maintain existing rates of ecosystem functions, processes and services, then they must concentrate efforts on avoiding anthropogenic disturbance in areas of currently undisturbed forests. It is also vital to prevent further disturbance in human-modified forests to avoid disrupting even more their recovery.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Berenguer","given":"Erika"},{"family":"Gardner","given":"Toby Alan"},{"family":"Ferreira","given":"Joice"},{"family":"Aragão","given":"Luiz E.

  {"id":"berenguerTrackingImpactsNino2021","abstract":"With humanity facing an unprecedented climate crisis, the conservation of tropical forests has never been so important – their vast terrestrial carbon stocks can be turned into emissions by climatic and human disturbances. However, the duration of these effects is poorly understood, and it is unclear whether impacts are amplified in forests with a history of previous human disturbance. Here, we focus on the Amazonian epicenter of the 2015–16 El Niño, a region that encompasses 1.2% of the Brazilian Amazon. We quantify, at high temporal resolution, the impacts of an extreme El Niño (EN) drought and extensive forest fires on plant mortality and carbon loss in undisturbed and human-modified forests. Mortality remained higher than pre-El Niño levels for 36 mo in EN-drought–affected forests and for 30 mo in EN-fire–affected forests. In EN-fire–affected forests, human disturbance significantly increased plant mortality. Our investigation of the ecological and physiological predictors of tree mortality showed that trees with lower wood density, bark thickness and leaf nitrogen content, as well as those that experienced greater fire intensity, were more vulnerable. Across the region, the 2015–16 El Niño led to the death of an estimated 2.5 ± 0.3 billion stems, resulting in emissions of 495 ± 94 Tg CO2. Three years after the El Niño, plant growth and recruitment had offset only 37% of emissions. Our results show that limiting forest disturbance will not only help maintain carbon stocks, but will also maximize the resistance of Amazonian forests if fires do occur.*","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Berenguer","given":"Erika"},{"family":"Lennox","given":"Gareth D."},{"family":"Ferreira","given":"Joice"},{"family":"Malhi","given":"Yadvinder"},{"family":"Aragão","given":"Luiz E.

  {"id":"besnardMappingGlobalForest2021","abstract":"Forest age can determine the capacity of a forest to uptake carbon from the atmosphere. However, a lack of global diagnostics that reflect the forest stage and associated disturbance regimes hampers the quantification of age-related differences in forest carbon dynamics. This study provides a new global distribution of forest age circa 2010, estimated using a machine learning approach trained with more than 40 000 plots using forest inventory, biomass and climate data. First, an evaluation against the plot-level measurements of forest age reveals that the data-driven method has a relatively good predictive capacity of classifying old-growth vs. non-old-growth (precision = 0.81 and 0.99 for old-growth and non-old-growth, respectively) forests and estimating corresponding forest age estimates (NSE = 0.6 – Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency – and RMSE = 50 years – root-mean-square error). However, there are systematic biases of overestimation in young- and underestimation in old-forest stands, respectively. Globally, we find a large variability in forest age with the old-growth forests in the tropical regions of Amazon and Congo, young forests in China, and intermediate stands in Europe. Furthermore, we find that the regions with high rates of deforestation or forest degradation (e.g. the arc of deforestation in the Amazon) are composed mainly of younger stands. Assessment of forest age in the climate space shows that the old forests are either in cold and dry regions or warm and wet regions, while young–intermediate forests span a large climatic gradient. Finally, comparing the presented forest age estimates with a series of regional products reveals differences rooted in different approaches and different in situ observations and global-scale products. Despite showing robustness in cross-validation results, additional methodological insights on further developments should as much as possible harmonize data across the different approaches. The forest age dataset presented here provides additional insights into the global distribution of forest age to better understand the global dynamics in the forest water and carbon cycles.

Here we combined global crop yield and environmental data in a ~1-million-dimensional mathematical optimisation framework to determine how optimising the spatial distribution of global croplands could reduce environmental impacts whilst maintaining current crop production levels. We estimate that relocating current croplands to optimal locations, whilst allowing ecosystems in then-abandoned areas to regenerate, could simultaneously decrease the current carbon, biodiversity, and irrigation water footprint of global crop production by 71%, 87%, and 100%, respectively, assuming high-input farming on newly established sites. The optimal global distribution of crops is largely similar for current and end-of-century climatic conditions across emission scenarios. Substantial impact reductions could already be achieved by relocating only a small proportion of worldwide crop production, relocating croplands only within national borders, and assuming less intensive farming systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Beyer","given":"Robert M."},{"family":"Hua","given":"Fangyuan"},{"family":"Martin","given":"Philip A."},{"family":"Manica","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Rademacher","given":"Tim"}],"citation-key":"beyerRelocatingCroplandsCould2022","container-title":"Communications Earth & Environment","container-title-short":"Commun Earth Environ","DOI":"10.1038/s43247-022-00360-6","ISSN":"2662-4435","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",12]]},"language":"en","page":"49","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Relocating croplands could drastically reduce the environmental impacts of global food production","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-022-00360-6","volume":"3"},

Some researchers have recognized this, and a recent push has been made to understand how human behaviour and ecological systems interact through dynamic social-ecological systems. Here, we use a recent example of a social-ecological dynamical systems model to investigate the relationship between harvesting behaviour and the dynamics and stability of a harvested resource, and search for general rules in how relatively simple human behaviours can either stabilize or destabilize resource dynamics and yield. Our results suggest that weak to moderate behavioural and effort responses tend to stabilize dynamics by decreasing return times to equilibria or reducing the magnitude of cycles; however, relatively strong human impacts can readily lead to human-driven cycles, chaos, long transients and alternate states. Importantly, we further show that human-driven cycles are characteristically different from typical resource-driven cycles and, therefore, may be differentiated in real ecosystems. Given the potentially dramatic implications of harvesting on resource dynamics, it becomes critical to better understand how human behaviour determines harvesting effort through dynamic social-ecological systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Bieg","given":"Carling"},{"family":"McCann","given":"Kevin S."},{"family":"Fryxell","given":"John M."}],"citation-key":"biegDynamicalImplicationsHuman2017","container-title":"Theoretical Ecology","container-title-short":"Theor Ecol","DOI":"10.1007/s12080-017-0334-3","ISSN":"1874-1746","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"341-354","source":"Springer Link","title":"The dynamical implications of human behaviour on a social-ecological harvesting model","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12080-017-0334-3","volume":"10"},
  {"id":"birkhoferEcosystemServicesCurrent2015","abstract":"The concept of ecosystem services was originally developed to illustrate the beneﬁts that natural ecosystems generate for society and to raise awareness for biodiversity and ecosystem conservation. In this article we identify major challenges and opportunities for ecologists involved in empirical or modeling ecosystem service research. The ﬁrst challenge arises from the fact that the ecosystem service concept has not been generated in the context of managed systems. Ecologists need to identify the effect of anthropogenic interventions in order to propose practices to beneﬁt service-providing organisms and associated services. The second challenge arises from the need to evaluate relationships between indicators of ecosystem services that are collected in ecological studies while accounting for uncertainties of ecological processes that underlie these services. We suggest basing the assessment of ecosystem services on the utilization of sets of indicators that cover aspects of service-providing units, ecosystem management and landscape modiﬁcation. The third challenge arises from the limited understanding of the nature of relationships between services and a lack of a general statistical framework to address these links. To manage ecosystem service provisioning, ecologists need to establish whether services respond to a shared driver or if services are directly linked to each other. Finally, studies relating biodiversity to ecosystem services often focus on services at small spatial or short temporal scales, but research on the protection of services is often directed toward services providing beneﬁts at large spatial scales. Ecological research needs to address a range of spatial and temporal scales to provide a multifaceted understanding of how nature promotes human well-being. Addressing these challenges in the future offers a unique opportunity for ecologists to act as promoters for the understanding about how to conserve beneﬁts gained from nature.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Birkhofer","given":"Klaus"},{"family":"Diehl","given":"Eva"},{"family":"Andersson","given":"Jesper"},{"family":"Ekroos","given":"Johan"},{"family":"FrÃ¼h-MÃ¼ller","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Machnikowski","given":"Franziska"},{"family":"Mader","given":"Viktoria L."},{"family":"Nilsson","given":"Lovisa"},{"family":"Sasaki","given":"Keiko"},{"family":"RundlÃ¶f","given":"Maj"},{"family":"Wolters","given":"Volkmar"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Henrik G."}],"citation-key":"birkhoferEcosystemServicesCurrent2015","container-title":"Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution","container-title-short":"Front.

  {"id":"biroLANDUSELAND2013","abstract":"Several decades of intensive dry land farming in the Gadarif region, located in the Eastern part of Sudan, has led to rapid land use/land cover (LULC) changes mainly due to agricultural expansion, government policies and environmental calamities such as drought. In this paper, an attempt has been made to analyse and monitor the LULC changes using multi‐temporal Landsat data for the years 1979, 1989 and 1999 and ASTER data for the year 2009. In addition, efforts were made to discuss the impact of LULC changes on the selected soil properties. For this, a post‐classiﬁcation comparison technique was used to detect LULC changes from satellite images. Primarily, three main LULC types were selected to investigate the properties of soil, namely, cultivated land, fallow land and woodland. Moreover, soil samples were also collected at two depths of surface soil from ten sample plots for each of the LULC type. For these soil samples, various soil properties such as texture, bulk density, organic matter, soil pH, electrical conductivity, sodium adsorption ratio, phosphorous and potassium were analysed. The results showed that a signiﬁcant and extensive change of LULC patterns has occurred in the last three decades in the study area. Further, laboratory tests revealed that soil properties were signiﬁcantly affected by these LULC changes. The change of the physical and chemical properties of the soil may have attributed to the changes in the LULC resulting in land degradation, which in turn has led to a decline in soil productivity.

Here, we quantify changes of Amazon resilience by applying established indicators (for example, measuring lag-1 autocorrelation) to remotely sensed vegetation data with a focus on vegetation optical depth (1991–2016). We find that more than three-quarters of the Amazon rainforest has been losing resilience since the early 2000s, consistent with the approach to a critical transition. Resilience is being lost faster in regions with less rainfall and in parts of the rainforest that are closer to human activity.

  {"id":"brancalionEcosystemRestorationJob2022","abstract":"The central motivation to restore ecosystems at a planetary scale has been to reverse degradation and provide multiple environmental benefits, but key global players like governments may be more interested in social outcomes from undertaking restoration, such as job creation. Assessing the job opportunities stemming from ongoing restoration programmes can leverage additional investments for their implementation and support their long-term maintenance. Here, we aimed to understand and quantify current and potential ecosystem restoration jobs in Brazil, based on a widely distributed online survey performed in 2020 and led by the main restoration networks in the country. We explored the structure, job distribution and outputs of the national restoration supply chain. At the beginning of 2020, 4713 temporary and 3510 permanent jobs were created, nearly 60% of which were generated by organizations specialized in restoration, mainly from the non-profit (48%) and private (37%) sectors. Restoration jobs were concentrated in organizations working in one (58%) or two (28%) biomes, and the vast majority were in the Atlantic Forest (85%). Similarly, most restoration jobs were concentrated in the southeast region (61%), with one-third in the state of São Paulo. This geographical distribution was more strongly associated with the states' GDP than with the legal deficit of native vegetation area. Nearly 20% of the restoration jobs were terminated during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. We estimate that restoration activities can generate 0.42 jobs per hectare undergoing restoration, which could potentially create 1.0–2.5 million direct jobs through the implementation of Brazil's target of restoring 12 million hectares. We conclude by reinforcing the value of ecosystem restoration in promoting economic development and job creation, which can be crucial to promote countries' effective engagement in the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration. We also highlight the critical role of grassroots organizations to maximize restoration opportunities for socioeconomic development during the post-pandemic economic recovery.

By overlaying seven recent, peer-reviewed spatial datasets as proxies for socioenvironmental benefits and feasibility of restoration, we identified restoration opportunities (areas with higher potential return of benefits and feasibility) in lowland tropical rainforest landscapes. We found restoration opportunities throughout the tropics. Areas scoring in the top 10% (i.e., restoration hotspots) are located largely within conservation hotspots (88%) and in countries committed to the Bonn Challenge (73%), a global effort to restore 350 Mha by 2030. However, restoration hotspots represented only a small portion (19.1%) of the Key Biodiversity Area network. Concentrating restoration investments in landscapes with high benefits and feasibility would maximize the potential to mitigate anthropogenic impacts and improve human well-being.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Brancalion","given":"Pedro H.

  {"id":"brancalionMaximizingBiodiversityConservation2018","abstract":"Assessing the conservation value of restoration plantings is critical to support the global forest landscape restoration movement. We assessed the implications of tree species selection in the restoration of Brazil's Atlantic Forest regarding carbon stocking and species conservation. This assessment was based on a comprehensive dataset of seedling acquisition records from 961 restoration projects, more than14 million seedlings, 192 forest remnants, and functional data from 1,223 tree species. We found that animal-dispersed trees with larger seeds tend to have higher seed prices, yet are underrepresented in the seedlings acquired for restoration plantations. Compared to forest remnants, fruit supply potentially offered by the species acquired for restoration plantings is lower for birds, but higher for bats. Reduced abundance of medium- and/or large-seeded, animal-dispersed trees lead to declines of 2.8–10.6% in simulated potential carbon stocking. Given the uncertainty in these estimates, policy interventions may be needed to encourage greater representation of large-seeded, animal-dispersed tree species in Atlantic Forest restorations. These findings provide critical guidance for recovering tree functional diversity, plant-frugivore mutualistic interactions, and carbon stocking in multi-species tropical forest restoration plantings.","author":[{"family":"Brancalion","given":"Pedro H.

  {"id":"brandaoThreatsSustainabilityBrazil2023","abstract":"Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa) is an important species in the Amazon, but the relationships between seed production and climate change are still poorly understood. Seed production data were obtained for the entire Brazilian Amazon, while data on precipitation, relative humidity, vapor pressure deficit, and temperature (mean and maximum) were collected to test their relationship with seed production in the Baixo Amazonas. Annual seed production in the Baixo Amazonas varied between 2156 and 10,235 tons per year from 1990 to 2021, with an average of 5192 tons per year. Linear regression analyses did not identify significant relationships between seed production and climatic variables during the same year (p > 0.05). However, significant relationships were found between the volume of seeds in the base year and climatic variables from 1 year before seed collection (p < 0.05), except for total precipitation (p = 0.15). Temperature was the main climatic variable affecting Brazil nut production, indicating that each 1°C increase in temperature is associated with an average decrease in seed volume ranging from 2595 to 2673 tons. Temperature measures explain between 38% and 42% of the variability in seed volume in the Baixo Amazonas. Therefore, it is crucial to mitigate global warming, invest in technological processes to add value to the remaining seeds, and adopt B. excelsa varieties more adapted to climate change.","author":[{"family":"Brandão","given":"Diego"},{"family":"Arieira","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Nobre","given":"Carlos"}],"citation-key":"brandaoThreatsSustainabilityBrazil2023","DOI":"10.5772/intechopen.113715","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,1]]},"source":"ResearchGate","title":"Threats and Sustainability of Brazil Nut ( Bertholletia excelsa Bonpl.)

  {"id":"bretfeldPlantWaterUse2018","abstract":"Tropical forests are increasingly being subjected to hotter, drier conditions as a result of global climate change. The effects of drought on forests along successional gradients remain poorly understood. We took advantage of the 2015–2016 El Niño event to test for differences in drought response along a successional gradient by measuring the sap flow in 76 trees, representing 42 different species, in 8-, 25- and 80-yr-old secondary forests in the 15-km2 ‘Agua Salud Project’ study area, located in central Panama. Average sap velocities and sapwood-specific hydraulic conductivities were highest in the youngest forest. During the dry season drought, sap velocities increased significantly in the 80-yr-old forest as a result of higher evaporative demand, but not in younger forests. The main drivers of transpiration shifted from radiation to vapor pressure deficit with progressing forest succession. Soil volumetric water content was a limiting factor only in the youngest forest during the dry season, probably as a result of less root exploration in the soil. Trees in early-successional forests displayed stronger signs of regulatory responses to the 2015–2016 El Niño drought, and the limiting physiological processes for transpiration shifted from operating at the plant–soil interface to the plant–atmosphere interface with progressing forest succession.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Bretfeld","given":"Mario"},{"family":"Ewers","given":"Brent E."},{"family":"Hall","given":"Jefferson S."}],"citation-key":"bretfeldPlantWaterUse2018","container-title":"New Phytologist","DOI":"10.1111/nph.15071","ISSN":"1469-8137","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2018 The Authors.

(2) Soil nutrient concentration generally was independent of age or prior intensity of use in the pastures. Pastures use has a significant effect on soil nutrient concentration when the sites are first abandoned, but this does not persist. Nutrient uptake by successional vegetation may substantially reduce soil nutrient stocks. (3) Soil nutrient concentration was not significantly correlated with vegetation biomass, primary tree biomass or species richness, lighter among or willing sites. (4) Nutrient depletion of pastures abandoned eight years previously relative to total nutrient stocks in mature forest depended on pasture disturbance. Sites previously subjected to low use were only depleted of N, moderate-use sites were depleted of N and K, and heavy-use were depleted of N, K, Mg and possibly Ca and P. There were less nutrient depletion than the relatively small biomass of the successional sites would indicate. This was due to a higher proportion of nutrient-rich leaves and fine branches, enriched soil nutrient stocks relative to mature forest and, on the lightly disturbed sites, a large pool of nutrients in unburned woody residue. (5) Decomposition of unburned woody residue may provide one-half of the nutrients taken up by vegetaion durign eight years of recovery following light pasture use, but only 15% following moderate use, and none following the moist intense use.

More than 30 years of continuous data were thought to be needed to detect a trend driven by climate change1. Here we show that climate-change trends emerge more rapidly in ocean colour (remote-sensing reflectance, Rrs), because Rrs is multivariate and some wavebands have low interannual variability. We analyse a 20-year Rrs time series from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard the Aqua satellite, and find significant trends in Rrs for 56% of the global surface ocean, mainly equatorward of 40°. The climate-change signal in Rrs emerges after 20 years in similar regions covering a similar fraction of the ocean in a state-of-the-art ecosystem model2, which suggests that our observed trends indicate shifts in ocean colour—and, by extension, in surface-ocean ecosystems—that are driven by climate change.

To address their policy implications, we incorporated five interacting climate tipping points into a stochastic-dynamic integrated assessment model, calibrating their likelihoods and interactions on results from an existing expert elicitation. Here we show that combining realistic assumptions about policymakers’ preferences under uncertainty, with the prospect of multiple future interacting climate tipping points, increases the present social cost of carbon in the model nearly eightfold from US$15 per tCO2 to US$116 per tCO2. Furthermore, passing some tipping points increases the likelihood of other tipping points occurring to such an extent that it abruptly increases the social cost of carbon. The corresponding optimal policy involves an immediate, massive effort to control CO2 emissions, which are stopped by mid-century, leading to climate stabilization at <1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Cai","given":"Yongyang"},{"family":"Lenton","given":"Timothy M."},{"family":"Lontzek","given":"Thomas S."}],"citation-key":"caiRiskMultipleInteracting2016","container-title":"Nature Climate Change","container-title-short":"Nature Clim Change","DOI":"10.1038/nclimate2964","ISSN":"1758-6798","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",5]]},"language":"en","license":"2016 Springer Nature Limited","number":"5","page":"520-525","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www-nature-com.proxy3.library.mcgill.ca","title":"Risk of multiple interacting tipping points should encourage rapid CO2 emission reduction","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2964","volume":"6"},

Many projects aimed at reconciling the goals of biodiversity conservation and social aspirations within protected areas (PAs) have failed on one or both counts. Here, we investigate the social consequences of living either inside or outside sustainable-use PAs in the Brazilian Amazon, using data from more than 100 local communities along a 2,000-km section of a major Amazonian river. The PAs in this region are now widely viewed as conservation triumphs, having implemented community comanagement of fisheries and recovery of overexploited wildlife populations. We document clear differences in social welfare in communities inside and outside PAs. Specifically, communities inside PAs enjoy better access to health care, education, electricity, basic sanitation, and communication infrastructure. Moreover, living within a PA was the strongest predictor of household wealth, followed by cash-transfer programs and the number of people per household. These collective cobenefits clearly influence life satisfaction, with only 5% of all adult residents inside PAs aspiring to move to urban centers, compared with 58% of adults in unprotected areas. Our results clearly demonstrate that large-scale “win–win” conservation solutions are possible in tropical countries with limited financial and human resources and reinforce the need to genuinely empower local people in integrated conservation-development programs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Campos-Silva","given":"João V."},{"family":"Peres","given":"Carlos A."},{"family":"Hawes","given":"Joseph E."},{"family":"Haugaasen","given":"Torbjørn"},{"family":"Freitas","given":"Carolina T."},{"family":"Ladle","given":"Richard J."},{"family":"Lopes","given":"Priscila F.

Community-based conservation management has shown potential for integrating socio-economic needs with conservation goals in tropical environments; however, assessing the effectiveness of this approach is often held back by the lack of comprehensive ecological assessments. We conduct a robust ecological evaluation of the largest community-based conservation management initiative in the Brazilian Amazon over the last 40 years. We show that this programme has induced large-scale population recovery of the target giant South American turtle (Podocnemis expansa) and other freshwater turtles along a 1,500-km section of a major tributary of the Amazon River. Poaching activity on protected beaches was around 2% compared to 99% on unprotected beaches. We also find positive demographic co-benefits across a wide range of non-target vertebrate and invertebrate taxa. As a result, beaches protected by local communities represent islands of high biodiversity, while unprotected beaches remain ‘empty and silent’, showing the effectiveness of empowering local conservation action, particularly in countries experiencing shortages in financial and human resources.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Campos-Silva","given":"João V."},{"family":"Hawes","given":"Joseph E."},{"family":"Andrade","given":"Paulo C.

In these altered environments, the literature indicates that fruit production of the remaining Brazil nut trees is lower than those of adjacent forest with a significant occurrence of B. excelsa (Brazil nut groves). The objective of this study was to explore which factors better explain the low fruit production of Brazil nut trees in deforested areas. We studied dendrometric variables, soil physical parameters, litter and microclimatic variables. The results showed that pasture areas presented higher values of soil density, lower values of soil moisture and litter, as well as drier and warmer microclimatic conditions than in the forested areas. The average distance between the trees was significantly greater in the pasture area than in the Brazil nut groves, in contrast, the canopy area of B. excelsa trees was on average significantly smaller than in the Brazil nut groves, thus reducing the possibilities of pollination of the trees. In summary, more unfavorable environmental conditions in pasture areas (soil, microclimate, physical isolation) could partially explain the low fruit production of Brazil nut trees compared to observed production in adjacent forests.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Cardoso","given":"Gilnei Samuel Souza"},{"family":"Scoles","given":"Ricardo"},{"family":"Aragón","given":"Susan"}],"citation-key":"cardosoQueExplicaBaixa2022","container-title":"Scientia Forestalis","container-title-short":"Sci.

  {"id":"carnavalHistoricalClimateModelling2008","abstract":"Aim We aim to propose validated, spatially explicit hypotheses for the late Quaternary distribution of the Brazilian Atlantic forest, and thereby provide a framework for integrating analyses of species and genetic diversity in the region. Location The Atlantic forest, stretching along the Brazilian coast. Methods We model the spatial range of the forest under three climatic scenarios (current climate, 6000 and 21,000 years ago) with BIOCLIM and MAXENT. Historically stable areas or refugia are identified as the set of grid cells for which forest presence is inferred in all models and time projections. To validate inferred refugia, we test whether our models are matched by the current distribution of the forest and by fossil pollen data. We then investigate whether the location of inferred forest refugia is consistent with current patterns of species endemism and existing phylogeographical data. Results Forest models agree with pollen records and predict a large area of historical forest stability in the central corridor (Bahia), as well as a smaller refuge (Pernambuco) along the Brazilian coast, matching current centres of endemism in multiple taxa and mtDNA diversity patterns in a subset of the species examined. Less historical stability is predicted in coastal areas south of the Doce river, which agrees with most phylogeographical studies in that region. Yet some widely distributed taxa show high endemism in the southern Atlantic forest. This may be due to limitations of the modelling approach, differences in ecology and dispersal capability, historical processes not contemplated by the current study or inadequacy of the available test data sets. Main conclusions Palaeoclimatic models predict the presence of historical forest refugia in the Atlantic rain forest and suggest spatial variation in persistence of forests through the Pleistocene, predicting patterns of biodiversity in several local taxa. The results point to the need for further studies to document genetic and species endemism in the relatively poorly known and highly impacted areas of Atlantic rain forests of north-eastern Brazil.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Carnaval","given":"Ana Carolina"},{"family":"Moritz","given":"Craig"}],"citation-key":"carnavalHistoricalClimateModelling2008","container-title":"Journal of Biogeography","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-2699.2007.01870.x","ISSN":"1365-2699","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2008 The Authors.

Yet, biodiversity distribution data from within hotspots are too sparse for effective conservation in the face of rapid environmental change. Using frogs as indicators, ecological niche models under paleoclimates, and simultaneous Bayesian analyses of multispecies molecular data, we compare alternative hypotheses of assemblage-scale response to late Quaternary climate change. This reveals a hotspot within the Brazilian Atlantic forest hotspot. We show that the southern Atlantic forest was climatically unstable relative to the central region, which served as a large climatic refugium for neotropical species in the late Pleistocene.

  {"id":"carvajalMachineLearningMethods2018","abstract":"Background: Several studies have applied ecological factors such as meteorological variables to develop models and accurately predict the temporal pattern of dengue incidence or occurrence. With the vast amount of studies that investigated this premise, the modeling approaches differ from each study and only use a single statistical technique. It raises the question of whether which technique would be robust and reliable. Hence, our study aims to compare the predictive accuracy of the temporal pattern of Dengue incidence in Metropolitan Manila as influenced by meteorological factors from four modeling techniques, (a) General Additive Modeling, (b) Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with exogenous variables (c) Random Forest and (d) Gradient Boosting.\nMethods: Dengue incidence and meteorological data (flood, precipitation, temperature, southern oscillation index, relative humidity, wind speed and direction) of Metropolitan Manila from January 1, 2009 – December 31, 2013 were obtained from respective government agencies. Two types of datasets were used in the analysis; observed meteorological factors (MF) and its corresponding delayed or lagged effect (LG). After which, these datasets were subjected to the four modeling techniques. The predictive accuracy and variable importance of each modeling technique were calculated and evaluated.\nResults: Among the statistical modeling techniques, Random Forest showed the best predictive accuracy. Moreover, the delayed or lag effects of the meteorological variables was shown to be the best dataset to use for such purpose. Thus, the model of Random Forest with delayed meteorological effects (RF-LG) was deemed the best among all assessed models. Relative humidity was shown to be the top-most important meteorological factor in the best model.\nConclusion: The study exhibited that there are indeed different predictive outcomes generated from each statistical modeling technique and it further revealed that the Random forest model with delayed meteorological effects to be the best in predicting the temporal pattern of Dengue incidence in Metropolitan Manila. It is also noteworthy that the study also identified relative humidity as an important meteorological factor along with rainfall and temperature that can influence this temporal pattern.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Carvajal","given":"Thaddeus M."},{"family":"Viacrusis","given":"Katherine M."},{"family":"Hernandez","given":"Lara Fides T."},{"family":"Ho","given":"Howell T."},{"family":"Amalin","given":"Divina M."},{"family":"Watanabe","given":"Kozo"}],"citation-key":"carvajalMachineLearningMethods2018","container-title":"BMC Infectious Diseases","container-title-short":"BMC Infect Dis","DOI":"10.1186/s12879-018-3066-0","ISSN":"1471-2334","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",12]]},"language":"en","page":"183","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Machine learning methods reveal the temporal pattern of dengue incidence using meteorological factors in metropolitan Manila, Philippines","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-018-3066-0","volume":"18"},

We integrate ecological community metadata of 7,694 sampling sites for multiple organism groups in a machine learning model framework to map the research probability across the Brazilian Amazonia, while identifying the region's vulnerability to environmental change. 15%–18% of the most neglected areas in ecological research are expected to experience severe climate or land use changes by 2050.

  {"id":"cassinoEthnobotanyEthnoecologyApplied2019","abstract":"In this chapter, the reader will find guidelines and suggestions for the application of ethnobotanical and ethnoecological methods in archaeological sites and their surroundings, aiming to establish a closer dialogue between ethnobiology and archaeology for understanding the human history of past and present landscapes. The goal of such methodological proposals is to document the knowledge and practices of human populations that live on and around archaeological sites concerning the vegetation of these areas. The methods presented here can shed light on specific questions about the relationships between past human populations and their plant resources (e.g., practices of use, management, and domestication), helping to understand how people transformed the landscape and how the legacies of such relationships are visible in the present. This chapter is collectively written by ethnobiologists, botanists, ecologists, and archaeologists from several institutions working in the Amazon basin. Thus, examples presented here come mainly from research conducted in this region.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Cassino","given":"Mariana Franco"},{"family":"Alves","given":"Rubana Palhares"},{"family":"Levis","given":"Carolina"},{"family":"Watling","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Junqueira","given":"André Braga"},{"family":"Shock","given":"Myrtle P."},{"family":"Ferreira","given":"Maria Julia"},{"family":"Caetano Andrade","given":"Victor Lery"},{"family":"Furquim","given":"Laura P."},{"family":"Coelho","given":"Sara Deambrozi"},{"family":"Tamanaha","given":"Eduardo Kazuo"},{"family":"Neves","given":"Eduardo Góes"},{"family":"Clement","given":"Charles R."}],"citation-key":"cassinoEthnobotanyEthnoecologyApplied2019","collection-title":"Springer Protocols Handbooks","container-title":"Methods and Techniques in Ethnobiology and Ethnoecology","DOI":"10.1007/978-1-4939-8919-5_13","editor":[{"family":"Albuquerque","given":"Ulysses Paulino"},{"family":"Lucena","given":"Reinaldo Farias Paiva","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Cruz da Cunha","given":"Luiz Vital Fernandes"},{"family":"Alves","given":"Rômulo  Romeu Nóbrega"}],"event-place":"New York, NY","ISBN":"978-1-4939-8919-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","page":"187-208","publisher":"Springer","publisher-place":"New York, NY","source":"Springer Link","title":"Ethnobotany and Ethnoecology Applied to Historical Ecology","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-8919-5_13"},
  {"id":"cassolRetrievingSecondaryForest2019","abstract":"Secondary forests (SF) are important carbon sinks, removing CO 2 from the atmosphere through the photosynthesis process and storing photosynthates in their aboveground live biomass (AGB). This process occurring at large-scales partially counteracts C emissions from land-use change, playing, hence, an important role in the global carbon cycle. The absorption rates of carbon in these forests depend on forest physiology, controlled by environmental and climatic conditions, as well as on the past land use, which is rarely considered for retrieving AGB from remotely sensed data. In this context, the main goal of this study is to evaluate the potential of polarimetric (quad-pol) ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data for estimating AGB in a SF area. Land-use was assessed through Landsat time-series to extract the SF age, period of active land-use (PALU), and frequency of clear cuts (FC) to randomly select the SF plots. A chronosequence of 42 SF plots ranging 3-28 years (20 ha) near the Tapajós National Forest in Pará state was surveyed to quantifying AGB growth. The quad-pol data was explored by testing two regression methods, including non-linear (NL) and multiple linear regression models (MLR).We also evaluated the influence of the past land-use in the retrieving AGB through correlation analysis. The results showed that the biophysical variables were positively correlated with the volumetric scattering, meaning that SF areas presented greater volumetric scattering contribution with increasing forest age. Mean diameter, mean tree height, basal area, species density, and AGB were significant and had the highest Pearson coefficients with the Cloude decomposition (λ3), which in turn, refers to the volumetric contribution backscattering from cross-polarization (HV) (ρ = 0.57-0.66, p-value < 0.001). On the other hand, the historical use (PALU and FC) showed the highest correlation with angular decompositions, being the Touzi target phase angle the highest correlation (Φs) (ρ = 0.37 and ρ = 0.38, respectively). The combination of multiple prediction variables with MLR improved the AGB estimation by 70% comparing to the NL model (R 2 adj. = 0.51; RMSE = 38.7 Mg ha -1 ) bias = 2.1 ± 37.9 Mg ha -1 by incorporate the angular decompositions, related to historical use, and the contribution volumetric scattering, related to forest structure, in the model. The MLR uses six variables, whose selected polarimetric attributes were strongly related with different structural parameters such as the mean forest diameter, basal area, and the mean forest tree height, and not with the AGB as was expected. The uncertainty was estimated to be 18.6% considered all methodological steps of the MLR model. This approach helped us to better understand the relationship between parameters derived from SAR data and the forest structure and its relation to the growth of the secondary forest after deforestation events.","author":[{"family":"Cassol","given":"Henrique Luis Godinho"},{"family":"Carreiras","given":"João Manuel de Brito"},{"family":"Moraes","given":"Elisabete Caria"},{"family":"Aragão","given":"Luiz Eduardo Oliveira e Cruz","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Silva","given":"Camila Valéria de Jesus"},{"family":"Quegan","given":"Shaun"},{"family":"Shimabukuro","given":"Yosio Edemir"}],"citation-key":"cassolRetrievingSecondaryForest2019","container-title":"Remote Sensing","DOI":"10.3390/rs11010059","ISSN":"2072-4292","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"title":"Retrieving secondary forest aboveground biomass from polarimetric ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data in the Brazilian Amazon","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs11010059","volume":"11"},

  {"id":"cesarItNotJust2021","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              Natural regeneration of forests has significantly led to increased native forest cover in some regions. Several studies have explored the spatial drivers of forest cover increase, yet little is known about their effects on forest structure and species richness and diversity. We quantified the effects of local (forest age, remnant\n              Eucalyptus\n              basal area, slope, soil fertility, and clay content) and landscape drivers (surrounding land use, distance from streams, and surrounding forest cover and its change over time) on the aboveground biomass, species density, and phylogenetic diversity of native trees in second‐growth forests. We sampled 44 naturally regenerating forests established on former pastures and abandoned\n              Eucalyptus\n              plantations for 11–46 years in agricultural landscapes of the southeastern Atlantic Forest, Brazil. We used generalized linear mixed effect models to quantify the effect drivers on forest attributes. While only\n              Eucalyptus\n              basal area and proximity to sugarcane plantations had a consistent negative effect on forest biomass, other drivers were among the best models to explain forest attributes, but their effect was variable. Age increased tree biomass but the effect was not consistent. Similarly, species richness and phylogenetic diversity were mainly affected by landscape drivers such as surrounding forest cover. In tropical agricultural landscapes, effective forest recovery requires more than just time, as forest age can be less important in determining forest attributes than human land uses and surrounding native forest cover. Crucially, forest recovery can be improved through interventions and policies that promote less impactful human activities and enhance existing forest cover.\n            \n            Abstract in Portuguese is available with online material.\n          , \n            Resumo\n            \n              A regeneração natural é um processo influenciado por diversos fatores locais e de paisagem, o qual aumentou significativamente a cobertura florestal nativa em algumas regiões. Diversos estudos exploraram os principais fatores espaciais de aumento de cobertura florestal, no entanto, pouco se sabe sobre o efeito destes nos atributos das florestas regeneradas. Este trabalho objetiva quantificar os efeito relativo de fatores locais (idade da floresta, área basal de\n              Eucalyptus\n              , declividade, fertilidade e teor de argila do solo) e de paisagem (uso do solo no entorno, distância de cursos d’água e quantidade e mudança da cobertura florestal do entorno) sobre a biomassa, densidade de espécies e diversidade filogenética de árvores nativas nestas florestas regeneradas. Foram amostradas 44 florestas que regeneraram em pastagens e plantios de\n              Eucalyptus\n              por cerca de 11–46 anos em paisagens agrícolas da Mata Atlântica do Sudeste brasileiro. Foram utilizados modelos lineares generalizados mistos para quantificar o efeito de cada fator nos atributos florestais. Somente a área basal de eucalipto e a proximidade com cana‐de‐açúcar apresentaram um efeito negativo consistente na biomassa florestal, enquanto outros fatores estavam entre os melhores modelos para estimar atributos da floresta, mas seu efeito variou: a biomassa de espécies nativas aumentou com a idade, mas o efeito não foi consistente. De maneira semelhante, a riqueza de espécies e diversidade filogenética foram principalmente afetadas por fatores de paisagens como maior cobertura florestal do entorno. Em paisagens tropicais agrícolas, a restauração florestal efetiva requer mais do que tempo, já que a idade da floresta pode ser menos determinante dos atributos florestais do que o uso antrópico e a cobertura florestal circundante. Desta forma, restauração florestal pode ser melhorada através de intervenções e políticas públicas que promovam atividades humanas menos impactantes e aumentem a cobertura florestal.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"César","given":"Ricardo G."},{"family":"Moreno","given":"Vanessa De S."},{"family":"Coletta","given":"Gabriel D."},{"family":"Schweizer","given":"Daniella"},{"family":"Chazdon","given":"Robin L."},{"family":"Barlow","given":"Jos"},{"family":"Ferraz","given":"Silvio F.

We also assessed the robustness and eﬃciency of 22 nonparametric classiﬁcation algorithms for classifying irrigated crops in a semiarid region in the southeast of Spain.

More than 2000 visited plots for 12 diﬀerent crops along the study site were utilized as ground truth. Ensemble classiﬁers were the most robust algorithms but not the most eﬃcient because of their low prediction rate. Nearest neighbor methods and support vector machines have the best balance between robustness and eﬃciency as methods for classiﬁcation. Although the F1 score is close to 90%, some misclassiﬁcations were found for spring crops (e.g., barley, wheat and peas).

  {"id":"chaveGroundDataAre2019","abstract":"Several remote sensing missions will soon produce detailed carbon maps over all terrestrial ecosystems. These missions are dependent on accurate and representative in situ datasets for the training of their algorithms and product validation. However, long-term ground-based forest-monitoring systems are limited, especially in the tropics, and to be useful for validation, such ground-based observation systems need to be regularly revisited and maintained at least over the lifetime of the planned missions. Here we propose a strategy for a coordinated and global network of in situ data that would benefit biomass remote sensing missions. We propose to build upon existing networks of long-term tropical forest monitoring. To produce accurate ground-based biomass estimates, strict data quality must be guaranteed to users. It is more rewarding to invest ground resources at sites where there currently is assurance of a long-term commitment locally and where a core set of data is already available. We call these ‘supersites’. Long-term funding for such an inter-agency endeavour remains an important challenge, and we here provide costing estimates to facilitate dialogue among stakeholders. One critical requirement is to ensure in situ data availability over the lifetime of remote sensing missions. To this end, consistent guidelines for supersite selection and management are proposed within the Forest Observation System, long-term funding should be assured, and principal investigators of the sites should be actively involved.","author":[{"family":"Chave","given":"Jérôme"},{"family":"Davies","given":"Stuart J."},{"family":"Phillips","given":"Oliver L."},{"family":"Lewis","given":"Simon L."},{"family":"Sist","given":"Plinio"},{"family":"Schepaschenko","given":"Dmitry"},{"family":"Armston","given":"John"},{"family":"Baker","given":"Tim R."},{"family":"Coomes","given":"David"},{"family":"Disney","given":"Mathias"},{"family":"Duncanson","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Hérault","given":"Bruno"},{"family":"Labrière","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Meyer","given":"Victoria"},{"family":"Réjou-Méchain","given":"Maxime"},{"family":"Scipal","given":"Klaus"},{"family":"Saatchi","given":"Sassan"}],"citation-key":"chaveGroundDataAre2019","container-title":"Surv.

  {"id":"chaveImprovedAllometricModels2014","abstract":"Terrestrial carbon stock mapping is important for the successful implementation of climate change mitigation policies. Its accuracy depends on the availability of reliable allometric models to infer oven-dry aboveground biomass of trees from census data. The degree of uncertainty associated with previously published pantropical aboveground biomass allometries is large. We analyzed a global database of directly harvested trees at 58 sites, spanning a wide range of climatic conditions and vegetation types (4004 trees ≥ 5 cm trunk diameter). When trunk diameter, total tree height, and wood speciﬁc gravity were included in the aboveground biomass model as covariates, a single model was found to hold across tropical vegetation types, with no detectable effect of region or environmental factors. The mean percent bias and variance of this model was only slightly higher than that of locally ﬁtted models. Wood speciﬁc gravity was an important predictor of aboveground biomass, especially when including a much broader range of vegetation types than previous studies. The generic tree diameter–height relationship depended linearly on a bioclimatic stress variable E, which compounds indices of temperature variability, precipitation variability, and drought intensity. For cases in which total tree height is unavailable for aboveground biomass estimation, a pantropical model incorporating wood density, trunk diameter, and the variable E outperformed previously published models without height. However, to minimize bias, the development of locally derived diameter–height relationships is advised whenever possible. Both new allometric models should contribute to improve the accuracy of biomass assessment protocols in tropical vegetation types, and to advancing our understanding of architectural and evolutionary constraints on woody plant development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Chave","given":"Jérôme"},{"family":"Réjou-Méchain","given":"Maxime"},{"family":"Búrquez","given":"Alberto"},{"family":"Chidumayo","given":"Emmanuel"},{"family":"Colgan","given":"Matthew S."},{"family":"Delitti","given":"Welington B.C."},{"family":"Duque","given":"Alvaro"},{"family":"Eid","given":"Tron"},{"family":"Fearnside","given":"Philip M."},{"family":"Goodman","given":"Rosa C."},{"family":"Henry","given":"Matieu"},{"family":"Martínez-Yrízar","given":"Angelina"},{"family":"Mugasha","given":"Wilson A."},{"family":"Muller-Landau","given":"Helene C."},{"family":"Mencuccini","given":"Maurizio"},{"family":"Nelson","given":"Bruce W."},{"family":"Ngomanda","given":"Alfred"},{"family":"Nogueira","given":"Euler M."},{"family":"Ortiz-Malavassi","given":"Edgar"},{"family":"Pélissier","given":"Raphaël"},{"family":"Ploton","given":"Pierre"},{"family":"Ryan","given":"Casey M."},{"family":"Saldarriaga","given":"Juan G."},{"family":"Vieilledent","given":"Ghislain"}],"citation-key":"chaveImprovedAllometricModels2014","container-title":"Global Change Biology","container-title-short":"Glob Change Biol","DOI":"10.1111/gcb.12629","ISSN":"13541013","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",10]]},"language":"en","page":"3177-3190","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Improved allometric models to estimate the aboveground biomass of tropical trees","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.12629","volume":"20"},
  {"id":"chavesCBERSDataCubes2021","abstract":"The agricultural frontier expansion in the Cerrado biome made Brazil a leader in commodity exports and is changing its landscape. Hence, efforts to accurate land use and land cover (LULC) monitoring in this region are strategic, due to its role in Brazil’s food, environmental, and economic security policy. Thinking on planning and technical sovereignty in the spatial sector, the China–Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS) Program was launched to provide useful data for decision-makers to manage the Brazilian territory independently of external policies. Their data, especially from CBERS-4 Wide-Field Imager (CBERS-4/WFI), are largely applied in deforestation monitoring by remote sensing specialists but less applied than data from other image providers for machine learning-based LULC mapping due to the small number of spectral bands and limitations related to clouds and shadows detection. However, with advances in orbital data analysis, data cubes enabled storing and accessing large spatio-temporal analysis-ready data. Within this scope, the Brazil Data Cube Project (BDC) creates multidimensional data cubes from orbital sensors’ data for all Brazilian territory. We applied BDC CBERS-4/WFI data cubes to generate LULC classifications for the Extremo Oeste Baiano agricultural belt correspondent to the 2017/2018 and 2019/2020 harvest periods, at two levels of detail: broad and crop type, incorporating ground truth samples, crop calendar knowledge, and vegetation indices to a dense time series analysis approach. Overall Accuracies were equal to 0.87 and 0.89 for broad, and 0.91 and 0.94 for crop type classifications.

Contrastingly, it obliterates the temporal resolution improvement. As LULC changes are subtle over time, little is said about how much detail we lost by degrading temporal resolution. Data cube architectures enable storing, accessing, and modeling big data, mitigating losses. Brazil Data Cube (BDC) produces multidimensional data cube collections from different medium-resolution satellite data for Brazil, including S2/MSI.

  {"id":"chazdonCarbonSequestrationPotential2016","abstract":"Regrowth of tropical secondary forests following complete or nearly complete removal of forest vegetation actively stores carbon in aboveground biomass, partially counterbalancing carbon emissions from deforestation, forest degradation, burning of fossil fuels, and other anthropogenic sources. We estimate the age and spatial extent of lowland second-growth forests in the Latin American tropics and model their potential aboveground carbon accumulation over four decades. Our model shows that, in 2008, second-growth forests (1 to 60 years old) covered 2.4 million km2 of land (28.1%of the total study area).Over 40 years, these lands can potentially accumulate a total aboveground carbon stock of 8.48 Pg C (petagrams of carbon) in aboveground biomass via low-cost natural regeneration or assisted regeneration, corresponding to a total CO2 sequestration of 31.09 Pg CO2. This total is equivalent to carbon emissions from fossil fuel use and industrial processes in all of Latin America and the Caribbean from1993 to 2014. Ten countries account for 95% of this carbon storage potential, led by Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela. We model future land-use scenarios to guide national carbon mitigation policies. Permitting natural regeneration on 40% of lowland pastures potentially stores an additional 2.0 Pg C over 40 years. Our study provides information and maps to guide national-level forest-based carbon mitigation plans on the basis of estimated rates of natural regeneration and pasture abandonment. Coupled with avoided deforestation and sustainable forestmanagement, natural regeneration of second-growth forests provides a low-costmechanism that yields a high carbon sequestration potential with multiple benefits for biodiversity and ecosystem services.","author":[{"family":"Chazdon","given":"Robin L."},{"family":"Broadbent","given":"Eben N."},{"family":"Rozendaal","given":"Danaë M.

New forests are regenerating on former agricultural land, and forest plantations are being established for commercial and restoration purposes. Plantations and restored forests can improve ecosystem services and enhance biodiversity conservation, but will not match the composition and structure of the original forest cover. Approaches to restoring forest ecosystems depend strongly on levels of forest and soil degradation, residual vegetation, and desired restoration outcomes. Opportunities abound to combine ambitious forest restoration and regeneration goals with sustainable rural livelihoods and community participation.

  {"id":"chazdonMoreEffectiveIntegration2019","abstract":"Conservation and restoration interventions can be mutually reinforcing and are converging through an increased focus on social dimensions. This paper examines how to more effectively integrate the complementary goals of conservation and restoration of tropical forests. Forest conservation and restoration interventions are integral components of a broad approach to forest ecosystem and landscape management that aims to maintain and restore key ecological processes and enhance human well-being, while minimizing biodiversity loss. The forest transition model provides a useful framework for understanding the relative importance of forest conservation and restoration interventions in different regions. Harmonizing conservation and restoration presents serious challenges for forest policy in tropical countries, particularly regarding the use and management of secondary forests, fallow vegetation, and forests degraded by logging and fire. Research to implement restoration more effectively in tropical regions can be stimulated by transforming questions that initially focused on conservation issues. Examination of papers published in Biotropica from 2000–2018 shows that most studies relevant to tropical forest conservation do not address forest restoration issues. Forest restoration studies, on the other hand, show a consistent association with conservation issues. There is much scope for further integration of conservation and restoration in research, practice, and policy. Securing a sustainable future for tropical forests requires developing and applying integrated approaches to landscape management that effectively combine knowledge and tools from multiple disciplines with practical experience and engagement of local stakeholders.

  {"id":"chazdonNaturalRegenerationContext2016","abstract":"Large-scale and long-term restoration efforts are urgently needed to reverse historical global trends of deforestation and forest degradation in the tropics. Restoration of forests within landscapes offers multiple social, economic, and environmental beneﬁts that enhance lives of local people, mitigate effects of climate change, increase food security, and safeguard soil and water resources. Despite rapidly growing knowledge regarding the extent and feasibility of natural regeneration and the environmental and economic beneﬁts of naturally regenerating forests in the tropics, tree planting remains the major focus of restoration programs. Natural regeneration is often ignored as a viable land-use option. Here, we assemble a set of 16 original papers that provide an overview of the ecological, economic, and social dimensions of forest and landscape restoration (FLR), a relatively new approach to forest restoration that aims to regain ecological integrity and enhance human well-being in deforested or degraded forest landscapes. The papers describe how spontaneous (passive) and assisted natural regeneration can contribute to achieving multiple social and ecological beneﬁts. Forest and landscape restoration is centered on the people who live and work in the landscape and whose livelihoods will beneﬁt and diversify through restoration activities inside and outside of farms. Given the scale of degraded forestland and the need to mitigate climate change and meet human development needs in the tropics, harnessing the potential of natural regeneration will play an essential role in achieving the ambitious goals that motivate global restoration initiatives.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Chazdon","given":"Robin L."},{"family":"Uriarte","given":"María"}],"citation-key":"chazdonNaturalRegenerationContext2016","container-title":"Biotropica","container-title-short":"Biotropica","DOI":"10.1111/btp.12409","ISSN":"0006-3606, 1744-7429","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",11]]},"language":"en","page":"709-715","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Natural regeneration in the context of large‐scale forest and landscape restoration in the tropics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/btp.12409","volume":"48"},

Natural forest regeneration can potentially play a major role in large-scale landscape restoration in tropical regions. Here, we focus on the conditions that favor natural regeneration within tropical forest landscapes. We illustrate cases where large-scale natural regeneration followed forest clearing and non-forest land use, and describe the social and ecological factors that drove these local forest transitions. The self-organizing processes that create naturally regenerating forests and natural regeneration in planted forests promote local genetic adaptation, foster native species with known traditional uses, create spatial and temporal heterogeneity, and sustain local biodiversity and biotic interactions. These features confer greater ecosystem resilience in the face of future shocks and disturbances. We discuss economic, social, and legal issues that challenge natural regeneration in tropical landscapes. We conclude by suggesting ways to enable natural regeneration to become an effective tool for implementing large-scale forest and landscape restoration. Major research and policy priorities include: identifying and modeling the ecological and economic conditions where natural regeneration is a viable and favorable land-use option, developing monitoring protocols for natural regeneration that can be carried out by local communities, and developing enabling incentives, governance structures, and regulatory conditions that promote the stewardship of naturally regenerating forests. Aligning restoration goals and practices with natural regeneration can achieve the best possible outcome for achieving multiple social and environmental beneﬁts at minimal cost.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Chazdon","given":"Robin L."},{"family":"Guariguata","given":"Manuel R."}],"citation-key":"chazdonNaturalRegenerationTool2016","container-title":"Biotropica","container-title-short":"Biotropica","DOI":"10.1111/btp.12381","ISSN":"0006-3606, 1744-7429","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",11]]},"language":"en","page":"716-730","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Natural regeneration as a tool for large‐scale forest restoration in the tropics: prospects and challenges","title-short":"Natural regeneration as a tool for large‐scale forest restoration in the tropics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/btp.12381","volume":"48"},

We considered a complex hierarchy of factors that interact in space and time to determine the conservation potential of tropical secondary forests. Beyond the characteristics of local forest patches, spatial and temporal landscape dynamics influence the establishment, species composition, and persistence of secondary forests. Prospects for conservation of oldgrowth species in secondary forests are maximized in regions where the ratio of secondary to old-growth forest area is relatively low, older secondary forests have persisted, anthropogenic disturbance after abandonment is relatively low, seed-dispersing fauna are present, and old-growth forests are close to abandoned sites. The conservation value of a secondary forest is expected to increase over time, as species arriving from remaining old-growth forest patches accumulate. Many studies are poorly replicated, which limits robust assessments of the number and abundance of old-growth species present in secondary forests. Older secondary forests are not often studied and few long-term studies are conducted in secondary forests. Available data indicate that both old-growth and second-growth forests are important to the persistence of forest species in tropical, human-modified landscapes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Chazdon","given":"Robin L."},{"family":"Peres","given":"Carlos A."},{"family":"Dent","given":"Daisy"},{"family":"Sheil","given":"Douglas"},{"family":"Lugo","given":"Ariel E."},{"family":"Lamb","given":"David"},{"family":"Stork","given":"Nigel E."},{"family":"Miller","given":"Scott E."}],"citation-key":"chazdonPotentialSpeciesConservation2009","container-title":"Conservation Biology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1523-1739.2009.01338.x","ISSN":"08888892, 15231739","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",12]]},"language":"en","page":"1406-1417","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Potential for Species Conservation in Tropical Secondary Forests","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2009.01338.x","volume":"23"},

Our analysis focuses on vegetation change following abandonment of agricultural fields or pastures, as this is the most extensive form of major disturbance in Neotropical forests. We consider five tree community attributes: stem density, basal area, species density, species richness and species composition. We describe two case studies, in northeastern Costa Rica and Chiapas, Mexico, where both chronosequence and annual tree dynamics studies are being applied. These case studies show that the rates of change in tree communities often deviate from chronosequence trends. With respect to tree species composition, sites of different ages differ more than a single site followed over time through the same age range. Dynamic changes in basal area within stands, on the other hand, generally followed chronosequence trends. Basal area accumulation was more linked with tree growth rates than with net changes in tree density due to recruitment and mortality. Stem turnover rates were poor predictors of species turnover rates, particularly at longer time-intervals. Effects of the surrounding landscape on tree community dynamics within individual plots are poorly understood, but are likely to be important determinants of species accumulation rates and relative abundance patterns.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Chazdon","given":"Robin L"},{"family":"Letcher","given":"Susan G"},{"family":"Van Breugel","given":"Michiel"},{"family":"Martínez-Ramos","given":"Miguel"},{"family":"Bongers","given":"Frans"},{"family":"Finegan","given":"Bryan"}],"citation-key":"chazdonRatesChangeTree2007","container-title":"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","container-title-short":"Phil.

Although we are far from an integrated view of forest recovery processes, some generalizations can be made. Recovery of forest structure and composition is relatively rapid following disturbances that primarily impact forest canopies, such as hurricanes. Recovery is considerably slower following disturbances that heavily impact soils as well as aboveground vegetation, such as bulldozing, heavy or long-term grazing, and severe fires, often with long-lasting effects on species composition. The landscape matrix plays a critical role in local recovery processes. Proximity of disturbed areas to remnant forest patches promotes more rapid recovery, which depends heavily on seed dispersal. Recovery of aboveground biomass is constrained by soil fertility and texture across regions as well as across soil types within a region. Restoration of soil fertility may be a prerequisite for forest recovery on sites with severely degraded soils. Despite evidence of rapid forest recovery following large-scale deforestation, many degraded areas of today’s tropics will require human assistance to recover forest structure, species composition, and species interactions typical of mature tropical forests.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Chazdon","given":"Robin L."}],"citation-key":"chazdonTropicalForestRecovery2003","container-title":"Perspectives in Plant Ecology, Evolution and Systematics","container-title-short":"Perspectives in Plant Ecology, Evolution and Systematics","DOI":"10.1078/1433-8319-00042","ISSN":"14338319","issue":"1-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",1]]},"language":"en","page":"51-71","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Tropical forest recovery: legacies of human impact and natural disturbances","title-short":"Tropical forest recovery","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1433831904700670","volume":"6"},
  {"id":"chineaTropicalForestSuccession2002","abstract":"Secondary succession in tropical lands after human disturbances is becoming more common. Extensive areas of agricultural land have been abandoned in Puerto Rico during the last five decades due to economic changes, resulting in a dramatic increase in forest cover. This study documents forest structural and compositional changes along gradients of elevation and time since abandonment, and among substrate types. Sample sites were selected from a geographical information system database that included six forest age categories and three substrate types. A canonical correspondence analysis ordination of species abundance indicated relationships to site elevation, age of abandonment, substrate type, and bulldozing prior to abandonment. Structural comparisons among subsets of the data indicated that basal area and percent of exotics were greater while species diversity was lower on alluvial than on plutonic or volcanic substrates. Sites of intermediate age (13–30 years) at elevations >100m had greater numbers of exotics than sites ≤100m. Sites >30-year-old did not show significant differences in any structural characteristics among elevation categories. Species diversity was more than twice as high and the percent of exotics was less than half on non-bulldozed sites than on sites with a history of bulldozing prior to abandonment. Earlier floristic accounts of Puerto Rico under similar habitat conditions suggest that these forests are still missing some of the components of mature communities, particularly those habitats with a longer history of intensive utilization. It is in the later habitats that efforts for conservation of tropical communities should aim at preserving forest remnants or reintroducing species of the original vegetation.","author":[{"family":"Chinea","given":"J.

The aims of this study are to define the environmental conditions suitable for several mosquito species through species distribution modelling techniques, and to compare the results produced with the different techniques.\nMethods: Three different modelling techniques, i.e., non-linear discriminant analysis, random forest and generalised linear model, were used to investigate the environmental suitability in the Netherlands for three indigenous mosquito species (Culiseta annulata, Anopheles claviger and Ochlerotatus punctor). Results obtained with the three statistical models were compared with regard to: (i) environmental suitability maps, (ii) environmental variables associated with occurrence, (iii) model evaluation.\nResults: The models indicated that precipitation, temperature and population density were associated with the occurrence of Cs. annulata and An. claviger, whereas land surface temperature and vegetation indices were associated with the presence of Oc. punctor. The maps produced with the three different modelling techniques showed consistent spatial patterns for each species, but differences in the ranges of the predictions. Non-linear discriminant analysis had lower predictions than other methods. The model with the best classification skills for all the species was the random forest model, with specificity values ranging from 0.89 to 0.91, and sensitivity values ranging from 0.64 to 0.95.\nConclusions: We mapped the environmental suitability for three mosquito species with three different modelling techniques. For each species, the maps showed consistent spatial patterns, but the level of predicted environmental suitability differed; NLDA gave lower predicted probabilities of presence than the other two methods. The variables selected as important in the models were in agreement with the existing knowledge about these species. All model predictions had a satisfactory to excellent accuracy; best accuracy was obtained with random forest. The insights obtained can be used to gain more knowledge on vector and non-vector mosquito species. The output of this type of distribution modelling methods can, for example, be used as input for epidemiological models of vector-borne diseases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Cianci","given":"Daniela"},{"family":"Hartemink","given":"Nienke"},{"family":"Ibáñez-Justicia","given":"Adolfo"}],"citation-key":"cianciModellingPotentialSpatial2015","container-title":"International Journal of Health Geographics","container-title-short":"Int J Health Geogr","DOI":"10.1186/s12942-015-0001-0","ISSN":"1476-072X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"language":"en","page":"10","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Modelling the potential spatial distribution of mosquito species using three different techniques","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ij-healthgeographics.com/content/14/1/10","volume":"14"},

  {"id":"clevelandGlobalPatternsTerrestrial1999","abstract":"Human activities have clearly caused dramatic alterations of the terrestrial nitrogen cycle, and analyses of the extent and effects of such changes are now common in the scientific literature. However, any attempt to evaluate N cycling processes within ecosystems, as well as anthropogenic influences on the N cycle, requires an understanding of the magnitude of inputs via biological nitrogen fixation (BNF). Although there have been many studies addressing the microbiology, physiology, and magnitude of N fixation at local scales, there are very few estimates of BNF over large scales. We utilized >100 preexisting published estimates of BNF to generate biome- and global-level estimates of biological N fixation. We also used net primary productivity (NPP) and evapotranspiration (ET) estimates from the Century terrestrial ecosystem model to examine global relationships between these variables and BNF as well as to compare observed and Century-modeled BNF. Our data-based estimates showed a strong positive relationship between ecosystem ET and BNF, and our analyses suggest that while the model's simple relationships for BNF predict broad scale patterns, they do not capture much of the variability or magnitude of published rates. Patterns of BNF were also similar to patterns of ecosystem NPP. Our “best estimate” of potential nitrogen fixation by natural ecosystems is ∼195 Tg N yr−1, with a range of 100–290 Tg N yr−1. Although these estimates do not account for the decrease in natural N fixation due to cultivation, this would not dramatically alter our estimate, as the greatest reductions in area have occurred in systems characterized by relatively low rates of N fixation (e.g., grasslands). Although our estimate of BNF in natural ecosystems is similar to previously published estimates of terrestrial BNF, we believe that this study provides a more documented, constrained estimate of this important flux.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Cleveland","given":"Cory C."},{"family":"Townsend","given":"Alan R."},{"family":"Schimel","given":"David S."},{"family":"Fisher","given":"Hank"},{"family":"Howarth","given":"Robert W."},{"family":"Hedin","given":"Lars O."},{"family":"Perakis","given":"Steven S."},{"family":"Latty","given":"Erika F."},{"family":"Von Fischer","given":"Joseph C."},{"family":"Elseroad","given":"Adrien"},{"family":"Wasson","given":"Matt F."}],"citation-key":"clevelandGlobalPatternsTerrestrial1999","container-title":"Global Biogeochemical Cycles","DOI":"10.1029/1999GB900014","ISSN":"1944-9224","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999"]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright 1999 by the American Geophysical Union.","page":"623-645","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Global patterns of terrestrial biological nitrogen (N2) fixation in natural ecosystems","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/1999GB900014","volume":"13"},
  {"id":"clevelandNutrientAdditionsTropical2006","abstract":"Terrestrial biosphere–atmosphere carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange is dominated by tropical forests, where photosynthetic carbon (C) uptake is thought to be phosphorus (P)-limited. In P-poor tropical forests, P may also limit organic matter decomposition and soil C losses. We conducted a field-fertilization experiment to show that P fertilization stimulates soil respiration in a lowland tropical rain forest in Costa Rica. In the early wet season, when soluble organic matter inputs to soil are high, P fertilization drove large increases in soil respiration. Although the P-stimulated increase in soil respiration was largely confined to the dry-to-wet season transition, the seasonal increase was sufficient to drive an 18% annual increase in CO2 efflux from the P-fertilized plots. Nitrogen (N) fertilization caused similar responses, and the net increases in soil respiration in response to the additions of N and P approached annual soil C fluxes in mid-latitude forests. Human activities are altering natural patterns of tropical soil N and P availability by land conversion and enhanced atmospheric deposition. Although our data suggest that the mechanisms driving the observed respiratory responses to increased N and P may be different, the large CO2 losses stimulated by N and P fertilization suggest that knowledge of such patterns and their effects on soil CO2 efflux is critical for understanding the role of tropical forests in a rapidly changing global C cycle.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Cleveland","given":"Cory C."},{"family":"Townsend","given":"Alan R."}],"citation-key":"clevelandNutrientAdditionsTropical2006","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.0600989103","issue":"27","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",7,5]]},"page":"10316-10321","publisher":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","source":"www-pnas-org.proxy3.library.mcgill.ca (Atypon)","title":"Nutrient additions to a tropical rain forest drive substantial soil carbon dioxide losses to the atmosphere","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.0600989103","volume":"103"},

Although climate and nutrient availability regulate net primary production (NPP) and decomposition in all terrestrial ecosystems, the nature and extent of such controls in tropical forests remain poorly resolved. We conducted a meta-analysis of carbon-nutrient-climate relationships in 113 sites across the tropical forest biome. Our analyses showed that mean annual temperature was the strongest predictor of aboveground NPP (ANPP) across all tropical forests, but this relationship was driven by distinct temperature differences between upland and lowland forests. Within lowland forests (< 1000 m), a regression tree analysis revealed that foliar and soil-based measurements of phosphorus (P) were the only variables that explained a signiﬁcant proportion of the variation in ANPP, although the relationships were weak. However, foliar P, foliar nitrogen (N), litter decomposition rate (k), soil N and soil respiration were all directly related with total surface (0–10 cm) soil P concentrations. Our analysis provides some evidence that P availability regulates NPP and other ecosystem processes in lowland tropical forests, but more importantly, underscores the need for a series of large-scale nutrient manipulations –especially in lowland forests – to elucidate the most important nutrient interactions and controls.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Cleveland","given":"Cory C."},{"family":"Townsend","given":"Alan R."},{"family":"Taylor","given":"Philip"},{"family":"Alvarez-Clare","given":"Silvia"},{"family":"Bustamante","given":"Mercedes M.

Recent analyses indicate the existence of “Redfield-like” ratios in plants, and such data may provide insight into the nature of nutrient limitation in terrestrial ecosystems. We searched for analogous patterns in the soil and the soil microbial biomass by conducting a review of the literature. Although soil is characterized by high biological diversity, structural complexity and spatial heterogeneity, we found remarkably consistent C:N:P ratios in both total soil pools and the soil microbial biomass. Our analysis indicates that, similar to marine phytoplankton, element concentrations of individual phylogenetic groups within the soil microbial community may vary, but on average, atomic C:N:P ratios in both the soil (186:13:1) and the soil microbial biomass (60:7:1) are well-constrained at the global scale. We did see significant variation in soil and microbial element ratios between vegetation types (i.e., forest versus grassland), but in most cases, the similarities in soil and microbial element ratios among sites and across large scales were more apparent than the differences. Consistent microbial biomass element ratios, combined with data linking specific patterns of microbial element stoichiometry with direct evidence of microbial nutrient limitation, suggest that measuring the proportions of C, N and P in the microbial biomass may represent another useful tool for assessing nutrient limitation of ecosystem processes in terrestrial ecosystems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Cleveland","given":"Cory C."},{"family":"Liptzin","given":"Daniel"}],"citation-key":"clevelandStoichiometrySoilThere2007","container-title":"Biogeochemistry","container-title-short":"Biogeochemistry","DOI":"10.1007/s10533-007-9132-0","ISSN":"1573-515X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"235-252","source":"Springer Link","title":"C:N:P stoichiometry in soil: is there a “Redfield ratio” for the microbial biomass?","title-short":"C","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10533-007-9132-0","volume":"85"},

However, it is not known whether biodiversity depends solely on these climate conditions, or whether the size and fragmentation of these climates are also crucial. Here we shift the common perspective in global biodiversity studies, transitioning from geographic space to a climate-defined multidimensional space. Our findings suggest that larger and more isolated climate conditions tend to harbour higher diversity and species turnover among terrestrial tetrapods, encompassing more than 30,000 species. By considering both the characteristics of climate itself and its geographic attributes, we can explain almost 90% of the variation in global species richness. Half of the explanatory power (45%) may be attributed either to climate itself or to the geography of climate, suggesting a nuanced interplay between them. Our work evolves the conventional idea that larger climate regions, such as the tropics, host more species primarily because of their size7,8. Instead, we underscore the integral roles of both the geographic extent and degree of isolation of climates.

While international initiatives highlight potential contributions of forest restoration as a win-win for people and nature, we lack detailed information on how frontline restoration practitioners are addressing this challenge on the ground. Here, we present a systematic assessment of motivations, scale, and costs of forest restoration implemented by 166 practitioners across 14 countries in Latin America. We found that forest restoration is motivated by interlinked objectives and accordingly, most restoration practitioners concurrently used multiple interventions spanning a range of intensity of inputs matched to the scale of individual projects. Project scale influenced strategy, with low-intensity interventions like natural regeneration implemented when operating at larger scales (≥500 ha). However, active tree planting remains the most frequently used intervention (included in >92 % of programs). Costs of establishing planted areas vary most broadly at the project level ($4445/ha ± 4841 over first 3 years) with little evidence of efficiencies of scale and with additional financial support ($964/ha/yr) required ~10 years past establishment. Moreover, monitoring added substantial additional costs, and we identified widespread misalignment between indicators measured and the most frequently expressed objective of restoring biodiversity. Our results emphasize that, while a promising range of new forest restoration interventions are being implemented across Latin America, lower-cost interventions, accessible and practical monitoring strategies, and better alignment between funding cycles and actual time frames required to achieve restoration objectives are urgently needed to support successful outcomes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Cole","given":"Rebecca J."},{"family":"Werden","given":"Leland K."},{"family":"Arroyo","given":"Fidel Chiriboga"},{"family":"Quirós","given":"Karina Mendez"},{"family":"Cedeño","given":"Gerald Quirós"},{"family":"Crowther","given":"Thomas W."}],"citation-key":"coleForestRestorationPractice2024","container-title":"Biological Conservation","container-title-short":"Biological Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/j.biocon.2024.110608","ISSN":"0006-3207","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,1]]},"page":"110608","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Forest restoration in practice across Latin America","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320724001708","volume":"294"},

Matrix demography provides a tool to calculate lifetime statistics, but large samples from juvenile to adult are needed, and few such studies have been done in tropical trees because high species diversity limits sample sizes. The 50-ha plot at Barro Colorado in Panama was designed to provide large samples, and with 30 years of censuses, accurate population matrices can be constructed.\nMethods\nIn 31 abundant species, I divided all individuals ≥1 cm dbh into 4 or 5 size class in each of seven censuses. Movements of stems between size classes over two censuses are termed transitions, and I constructed complete transition matrices for each species. From the matrices, I derived analytic solutions for lifetime demographic statistics. Expected adult lifespan from the sapling stage was the key statistic.\nResults\nExpected adult lifespan from the sapling stage varied 100-fold over the 31 species, from 0.5 to 50 years, and maturation time varied from 19 to nearly 200 years. Species with the highest growth rates also had high death rates, and theoretical calculations of reproductive lifespan show that the fast-growing pioneer species have short expected adult lifespans relative to the average slow-growing, shade-tolerant species. Within the slow-growth category, however, there was high variation in expected adult lifespan, and several shade-tolerant species under-performed the pioneers in terms of adult lifespan.\nConclusions\nAnalytical solutions from population matrices allow theoretical analyses that integrate short-term growth records into lifespans of tropical trees. The analyses suggest that pioneer species must reproduce more successfully than shade-tolerant species to persist in the Barro Colorado forest. My next goal is to incorporate seed production and germination into lifetime matrix demography to test this hypothesis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Condit","given":"Richard"}],"citation-key":"conditExpectedAdultLifespan2022","container-title":"Forest Ecosystems","container-title-short":"Forest Ecosystems","DOI":"10.1016/j.fecs.2022.100053","ISSN":"2197-5620","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,1]]},"page":"100053","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Expected adult lifespan in tropical trees: Long-term matrix demography in a large plot","title-short":"Expected adult lifespan in tropical trees","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2197562022000537","volume":"9"},

This allowed us to test the prediction that demographic differences facilitate species richness, as suggested by the theory that a tradeoff between high growth and high survival allows species to coexist.

  {"id":"coopsFrameworkRealtimeForest2022","abstract":"Forestry inventory update is a critical component of sustainable forest management, requiring both the spatially explicit identification of forest cover change and integration of sampled or modelled components like growth and regeneration. Contemporary inventory data demands are shifting, with an increased focus on accurate attribute estimation via the integration of advanced remote sensing data such as airborne laser scanning (ALS). Key challenges remain, however, on how to maintain and update these next-generation inventories as they age. Of particular interest is the identification of remotely sensed data that can be applied cost effectively, as well as establishing frameworks to integrate these data to update information on forest condition, predict future growth and yield, and integrate information that can guide forest management or silvicultural decisions such as thinning and harvesting prescriptions. The purpose of this article is to develop a conceptual framework for forestry inventory update, which is also known as the establishment of a ‘living inventory’. The proposed framework contains the critical components of an inventory update including inventory and growth monitoring, change detection and error propagation. In the framework, we build on existing applications of ALS-derived enhanced inventories and integrate them with data from satellite constellations of free and open, analysis-ready moderate spatial resolution imagery. Based on a review of the current literature, our approach fits trajectories to chronosequences of pixel-level spectral index values to detect change. When stand-replacing change is detected, corresponding values of cell-level inventory attributes are reset and re-established based on an assigned growth curve. In the case of non–stand-replacing disturbances, cell estimates are modified based on predictive models developed between the degree of observed spectral change and relative changes in the inventory attributes. We propose that additional fine-scale data can be collected over the disturbed area, from sources such as CubeSats or remotely piloted airborne systems, and attributes updated based on these data sources. Cells not identified as undergoing change are assumed unchanged with cell-level growth curves used to increment inventory attributes. We conclude by discussing the impact of error propagation on the prediction of forest inventory attributes through the proposed near real-time framework, computing needs and integration of other available remote sensing data.","author":[{"family":"Coops","given":"Nicholas C."},{"family":"Tompalski","given":"Piotr"},{"family":"Goodbody","given":"Tristan R.

  {"id":"coopsModellingLidarderivedEstimates2021","abstract":"Light detection and ranging (lidar) data acquired from airborne or spaceborne platforms have revolutionized measurement and mapping of forest attributes. Airborne data are often either acquired using multiple overlapped flight lines to provide complete coverage of an area of interest, or using transects to sample a given population. Spaceborne lidar datasets are unique to each sensor and are sample- or profile-based with characteristics driven by acquisition mode and orbital parameters. To leverage the wealth of accurate vegetation structural data from these lidar systems, a number of approaches have been developed to extend these observations over broader areas, from local landscapes to the globe. In this review we examine studies that have utilised modelling approaches to extend air- or space-based lidar data with the aim of communicating methods, outcomes, and accuracies, and offering guidance on linking lidar metrics and lidar-derived forest attributes with broad-area predictors. Modelling approaches are developed for a variety of applications. In some cases, generation of spatially-exhaustive layers may be useful for forest management purposes, driving management and inventory decisions over smaller focus areas or regions. In other cases, outputs are designed for monitoring at regional or global scales, and may be – due to the spatial grain of the structural estimates – insufficiently accurate or reliable for management. From the reviewed studies, we found height, aboveground biomass and volume, derived from either upper proportions of a large-footprint full-waveform lidar profiles, or statistically modelled from discrete return small-footprint lidar point clouds, to be the most commonly extended forest attributes, followed by canopy cover, basal area and stand complexity. Assessment of the accuracy and bias of the extrapolated forest attributes varied with both independent and model-derived estimates. The coefficient of determination (R2) was the most often reported, followed by absolute and relative (i.e., as a proportion of the mean) root mean square error (RMSE and RMSE% respectively). Compilation of the stated accuracies suggested that the variance explained in predictions of forest height ranged from R2 = 0.38 to 0.90 (mean = 0.64), RMSE from 2 to 6m and RMSE% from 12 to 34%. For volume, R2 ranged from 0.25 to 0.72 (mean = 0.53) and RMSE from 60 to 87 m3/ha and for aboveground biomass (AGB) R2 ranged from 0.35 to 0.78 (mean = 0.55) and RMSE from 28 to 44 Mg/ha. There was no consensus on the level of accuracy required to support successful extension over larger areas. Ultimately, the review suggests that the information need motivating the spatial extension over larger areas drives the choice of the type of lidar data, spatial datasets and related grain. We conclude by discussing future directions and the outlook for new approaches including new lidar-derived response variables, advances in modelling approaches, and assessment of change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Coops","given":"Nicholas C."},{"family":"Tompalski","given":"Piotr"},{"family":"Goodbody","given":"Tristan R.

  {"id":"cordeiroFineRootDynamics2020","abstract":"A common assumption in tropical ecology is that root systems respond rapidly to climatic cues but that most of that response is limited to the uppermost layer of the soil, with relatively limited changes in deeper layers. However, this assumption has not been tested directly, preventing models from accurately predicting the response of tropical forests to environmental change.We measured seasonal dynamics of fine roots in an upper‐slope plateau in Central Amazonia mature forest using minirhizotrons to 90 cm depth, which were calibrated with fine roots extracted from soil cores.Root productivity and mortality in surface soil layers were positively correlated with precipitation, whereas root standing length was greater during the dry periods at the deeper layers. Contrary to historical assumptions, a large fraction of fine‐root standing biomass (46%) and productivity (41%) was found in soil layers deeper than 30 cm. Furthermore, root turnover decreased linearly with soil depth.Our findings demonstrate a relationship between fine‐root dynamics and precipitation regimes in Central Amazonia. Our results also emphasize the importance of deeper roots for accurate estimates of primary productivity and the interaction between roots and carbon, water, and nutrients.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Cordeiro","given":"Amanda L."},{"family":"Norby","given":"Richard J."},{"family":"Andersen","given":"Kelly M."},{"family":"Valverde‐Barrantes","given":"Oscar"},{"family":"Fuchslueger","given":"Lucia"},{"family":"Oblitas","given":"Erick"},{"family":"Hartley","given":"Iain P."},{"family":"Iversen","given":"Colleen M."},{"family":"Gonçalves","given":"Nathan B."},{"family":"Takeshi","given":"Bruno"},{"family":"Lapola","given":"David M."},{"family":"Quesada","given":"Carlos A."}],"citation-key":"cordeiroFineRootDynamics2020","container-title":"Plant-Environment Interactions","container-title-short":"Plant Environ Interact","DOI":"10.1002/pei3.10010","ISSN":"2575-6265","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,22]]},"page":"3-16","PMCID":"PMC10168058","PMID":"37284129","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Fine‐root dynamics vary with soil depth and precipitation in a low‐nutrient tropical forest in the Central Amazonia","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10168058/","volume":"1"},

  {"id":"correaGeographicPatternsTree2023","abstract":"Aim To investigate the geographic patterns and ecological correlates in the geographic distribution of the most common tree dispersal modes in Amazonia (endozoochory, synzoochory, anemochory and hydrochory). We examined if the proportional abundance of these dispersal modes could be explained by the availability of dispersal agents (disperser-availability hypothesis) and/or the availability of resources for constructing zoochorous fruits (resource-availability hypothesis). Time period Tree-inventory plots established between 1934 and 2019. Major taxa studied Trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH) ≥ 9.55 cm. Location Amazonia, here defined as the lowland rain forests of the Amazon River basin and the Guiana Shield. Methods We assigned dispersal modes to a total of 5433 species and morphospecies within 1877 tree-inventory plots across terra-firme, seasonally flooded, and permanently flooded forests. We investigated geographic patterns in the proportional abundance of dispersal modes. We performed an abundance-weighted mean pairwise distance (MPD) test and fit generalized linear models (GLMs) to explain the geographic distribution of dispersal modes. Results Anemochory was significantly, positively associated with mean annual wind speed, and hydrochory was significantly higher in flooded forests. Dispersal modes did not consistently show significant associations with the availability of resources for constructing zoochorous fruits. A lower dissimilarity in dispersal modes, resulting from a higher dominance of endozoochory, occurred in terra-firme forests (excluding podzols) compared to flooded forests. Main conclusions The disperser-availability hypothesis was well supported for abiotic dispersal modes (anemochory and hydrochory). The availability of resources for constructing zoochorous fruits seems an unlikely explanation for the distribution of dispersal modes in Amazonia. The association between frugivores and the proportional abundance of zoochory requires further research, as tree recruitment not only depends on dispersal vectors but also on conditions that favour or limit seedling recruitment across forest types.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Correa","given":"Diego F."},{"family":"Stevenson","given":"Pablo R."},{"family":"Umaña","given":"Maria Natalia"},{"family":"Coelho","given":"Luiz de Souza"},{"family":"Lima Filho","given":"Diógenes de Andrade"},{"family":"Salomão","given":"Rafael P."},{"family":"Amaral","given":"Iêda Leão","dropping-particle":"do"},{"family":"Wittmann","given":"Florian"},{"family":"Matos","given":"Francisca Dionízia de Almeida"},{"family":"Castilho","given":"Carolina V."},{"family":"Phillips","given":"Oliver L."},{"family":"Guevara","given":"Juan Ernesto"},{"family":"Carim","given":"Marcelo de Jesus Veiga"},{"family":"Magnusson","given":"William E."},{"family":"Sabatier","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Molino","given":"Jean-François"},{"family":"Irume","given":"Mariana Victória"},{"family":"Martins","given":"Maria Pires"},{"family":"Guimarães","given":"José Renan da Silva"},{"family":"Bánki","given":"Olaf S."},{"family":"Piedade","given":"Maria Teresa Fernandez"},{"family":"Pitman","given":"Nigel C.

  {"id":"cosmoIndirectEffectsShape2023","abstract":"Ecological interactions are one of the main forces that sustain Earth’s biodiversity. A major challenge for studies of ecology and evolution is to determine how these interactions affect the fitness of species when we expand from studying isolated, pairwise interactions to include networks of interacting species1–4. In networks, chains of effects caused by a range of species have an indirect effect on other species they do not interact with directly, potentially affecting the fitness outcomes of a variety of ecological interactions (such as mutualism)5–7. Here we apply analytical techniques and numerical simulations to 186 empirical mutualistic networks and show how both direct and indirect effects alter the fitness of species coevolving in these networks. Although the fitness of species usually increased with the number of mutualistic partners, most of the fitness variation across species was driven by indirect effects. We found that these indirect effects prevent coevolving species from adapting to their mutualistic partners and to other sources of selection pressure in the environment, thereby decreasing their fitness. Such decreases are distributed in a predictable way within networks: peripheral species receive more indirect effects and experience higher reductions in fitness than central species. This topological effect was also evident when we analysed an empirical study of an invasion of pollination networks by honeybees. As honeybees became integrated as a central species within networks, they increased the contribution of indirect effects on several other species, reducing their fitness. Our study shows how and why indirect effects can govern the adaptive landscape of species-rich mutualistic assemblages.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Cosmo","given":"Leandro G."},{"family":"Assis","given":"Ana Paula A."},{"family":"Aguiar","given":"Marcus A.

  {"id":"costaEffectsSelectiveLogging2003","abstract":"There is much interest in ways to exploit tropical timber without greatly changing forest processes and diversity. To achieve this, it is necessary to know the maximum logging intensity that can be used and how long the forest takes to recover from logging. Because little is known about the effects of selective logging on non-timber plant species, we examined the effects of logging intensity and time after logging on the diversity and abundance of flowering and fruiting understory plants in a Central Amazonian forest near Manaus, Brazil. Logging was carried out experimentally at varying intensities in eight 4 ha plots in 1987 and three plots in 1993. Logging intensity ranged between 14 and 45 m3/ha of extracted timber. Three plots were left as controls. Each month, from October 1996 to September 1998, we recorded the number of individuals and species of herbs, shrubs, small trees, and small palms that were flowering and fruiting in six transects per plot. We found 107 species flowering and 111 species fruiting. The abundance of flowering plants was affected by time after logging, but not by the intensity of logging. The abundance of fruiting plants was not related either to time after logging or logging intensity. Richness of flowering and fruiting plants was related to time after logging, but not to the intensity of logging. The results indicate that selective logging, at the intensities and scale analyzed, does not cause reductions in flower and fruit production by the understory community. Both quantity and quality of resources for animals are maintained and possibly even increased in logged areas, shortly after logging takes place. As the levels of reproduction in plots logged 11 years before remained close to those in controls, maintenance of the understory community does not seem to be problematical. /// Há muito interesse em se conseguir formas de explorar madeira nas florestas tropicais sem alterar drasticamente seus processos e diversidade. Para isto, é preciso saber qual a intensidade de corte máxima que pode ser aplicada e qual o tempo necessário para a recuperação da floresta. Como pouco se sabe sobre os efeitos do corte seletivo de madeira sobre as espécies não-madeireiras, este estudo examinou os efeitos da intensidade de corte do e do tempo pós-corte sobre a diversidade e abundância das plantas de sub-bosque florindo ou frutificando em uma floresta da Amazônia Central, próxima à Manaus, Brasil. O corte seletivo foi realizado experimentalmente em diferentes intensidades em oito parcelas de 4 ha em 1987 e em três parcelas em 1993. A intensidade de corte variou entre 14 e 45 m3/ha de madeira extraída. Três parcelas foram deixadas como controles. A cada mês, de outubro de 1996 a setembro de 1998, amostrou-se o número de espécies e indivíduos de ervas, arbustos, arvoretas e pequenas palmeiras florindo ou frutificando em seis transectos em cada parcela. Foram encontradas 107 espécies florindo e ll1 espécies frutificando. A abundância de plantas florindo esteve relacionada à idade da área explorada, mas não à intensidade de corte. A abundância de plantas frutificando não esteve relacionada com a idade da área explorada nem com a intensidade de corte. A riqueza de plantas florindo e frutificando esteve relacionada à idade da área explorada, mas não à intensidade de corte. Os resultados indicam que o corte seletivo, nas intensidades e escala analisadas, não causa redução na produção de flores e frutos pelo sub-bosque. Tanto a quantidade como a qualidade dos recursos para a fauna são mantidas e até podem chegar a aumentar pouco tempo após a exploração. Como os níveis de reprodução nas parcelas exploradas 11 anos atrás são próximos aos encontrados nos controles, a sobrevivência da comunidade do sub-bosque nas áreas de corte seletivo não parece ser problemática.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Costa","given":"Flávia R.

  {"id":"costaOtherSideTropical2023","abstract":"Tropical forest function is of global significance to climate change responses, and critically determined by water availability patterns. Groundwater is tightly related to soil water through the water table depth (WT), but historically neglected in ecological studies. Shallow WT forests (WT < 5 m) are underrepresented in forest research networks and absent in eddy flux measurements, although they represent c. 50% of the Amazon and are expected to respond differently to global-change-related droughts. We review WT patterns and consequences for plants, emerging results, and advance a conceptual model integrating environment and trait distributions to predict climate change effects. Shallow WT forests have a distinct species composition, with more resource-acquisitive and hydrologically vulnerable trees, shorter canopies and lower biomass than deep WT forests. During ‘normal’ climatic years, shallow WT forests have higher mortality and lower productivity than deep WT forests, but during moderate droughts mortality is buffered and productivity increases. However, during severe drought, shallow WT forests may be more sensitive due to shallow roots and drought-intolerant traits.

  {"id":"coveyCarbonBiogeochemistryClimate2021","abstract":"The Amazon Basin is at the center of an intensifying discourse about deforestation, land-use, and global change. To date, climate research in the Basin has overwhelmingly focused on the cycling and storage of carbon (C) and its implications for global climate. Missing, however, is a more comprehensive consideration of other significant biophysical climate feedbacks [i.e., CH4, N2O, black carbon, biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs), aerosols, evapotranspiration, and albedo] and their dynamic responses to both localized (fire, land-use change, infrastructure development, and storms) and global (warming, drying, and some related to El Niño or to warming in the tropical Atlantic) changes. Here, we synthesize the current understanding of (1) sources and fluxes of all major forcing agents, (2) the demonstrated or expected impact of global and local changes on each agent, and (3) the nature, extent, and drivers of anthropogenic change in the Basin. We highlight the large uncertainty in flux magnitude and responses, and their corresponding direct and indirect effects on the regional and global climate system. Despite uncertainty in their responses to change, we conclude that current warming from non-CO2 agents (especially CH4 and N2O) in the Amazon Basin largely offsets—and most likely exceeds—the climate service provided by atmospheric CO2 uptake. We also find that the majority of anthropogenic impacts act to increase the radiative forcing potential of the Basin. Given the large contribution of less-recognized agents (e.g., Amazonian trees alone emit ~3.5% of all global CH4), a continuing focus on a single metric (i.e., C uptake and storage) is incompatible with genuine efforts to understand and manage the biogeochemistry of climate in a rapidly changing Amazon Basin.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Covey","given":"Kristofer"},{"family":"Soper","given":"Fiona"},{"family":"Pangala","given":"Sunitha"},{"family":"Bernardino","given":"Angelo"},{"family":"Pagliaro","given":"Zoe"},{"family":"Basso","given":"Luana"},{"family":"Cassol","given":"Henrique"},{"family":"Fearnside","given":"Philip"},{"family":"Navarrete","given":"Diego"},{"family":"Novoa","given":"Sidney"},{"family":"Sawakuchi","given":"Henrique"},{"family":"Lovejoy","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Marengo","given":"Jose"},{"family":"Peres","given":"Carlos A."},{"family":"Baillie","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Bernasconi","given":"Paula"},{"family":"Camargo","given":"Jose"},{"family":"Freitas","given":"Carolina"},{"family":"Hoffman","given":"Bruce"},{"family":"Nardoto","given":"Gabriela B."},{"family":"Nobre","given":"Ismael"},{"family":"Mayorga","given":"Juan"},{"family":"Mesquita","given":"Rita"},{"family":"Pavan","given":"Silvia"},{"family":"Pinto","given":"Flavia"},{"family":"Rocha","given":"Flavia"},{"family":"Assis Mello","given":"Ricardo","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Thuault","given":"Alice"},{"family":"Bahl","given":"Alexis Anne"},{"family":"Elmore","given":"Aurora"}],"citation-key":"coveyCarbonBiogeochemistryClimate2021","container-title":"Frontiers in Forests and Global Change","ISSN":"2624-893X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"source":"Frontiers","title":"Carbon and Beyond: The Biogeochemistry of Climate in a Rapidly Changing Amazon","title-short":"Carbon and Beyond","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/ffgc.2021.618401","volume":"4"},

We combined the results of a global meta-analysis to quantify how biodiversity recovery in naturally regenerating forests deviates from biodiversity values in reference old-growth forests, with structural equation modeling, to identify direct and indirect associations between socioeconomic, biophysical and ecological factors and deviation in biodiversity recovery at a landscape scale. Low deviation within a landscape means higher chances of multiple sites in naturally regenerating forests successfully recovering biodiversity compared to reference forests. Deviation in biodiversity recovery was directly negatively associated with the percentage of cropland, forest cover, and positively associated with the percentage of urban areas in the surrounding landscape. These three factors mediated the indirect associations with rural population size, recent gross deforestation, time since natural regeneration started, mean annual temperature, mean annual water deficit, road density, land opportunity cost, percentage cover of strictly protected forest areas, and human population variation in the surrounding landscape. We suggest that natural forest restoration should be prioritized in landscapes with both low socioeconomic pressures on land use conversion to pasturelands and urban areas, and high percentage of forest cover.","author":[{"family":"Crouzeilles","given":"Renato"},{"family":"Maurenza","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Prieto","given":"Pablo V."},{"family":"Barros","given":"Felipe S.

  {"id":"crouzeillesEcologicalRestorationSuccess2017","abstract":"Is active restoration the best approach to achieve ecological restoration success (the return to a reference condition, that is, old-growth forest) when compared to natural regeneration in tropical forests? Our meta-analysis of 133 studies demonstrated that natural regeneration surpasses active restoration in achieving tropical forest restoration success for all three biodiversity groups (plants, birds, and invertebrates) and five measures of vegetation structure (cover, density, litter, biomass, and height) tested. Restoration success for biodiversity and vegetation structure was 34 to 56% and 19 to 56% higher in natural regeneration than in active restoration systems, respectively, after controlling for key biotic and abiotic factors (forest cover, precipitation, time elapsed since restoration started, and past disturbance). Biodiversity responses were based primarily on ecological metrics of abundance and species richness (74%), both of which take far less time to achieve restoration success than similarity and composition. This finding challenges the widely held notion that natural forest regeneration has limited conservation value and that active restoration should be the default ecological restoration strategy. The proposition that active restoration achieves greater restoration success than natural regeneration may have arisen because previous comparisons lacked controls for biotic and abiotic factors; we also did not find any difference between active restoration and natural regeneration outcomes for vegetation structure when we did not control for these factors. Future policy priorities should align the identified patterns of biophysical and ecological conditions where each or both restoration approaches are more successful, cost-effective, and compatible with socioeconomic incentives for tropical forest restoration.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Crouzeilles","given":"Renato"},{"family":"Ferreira","given":"Mariana S."},{"family":"Chazdon","given":"Robin L."},{"family":"Lindenmayer","given":"David B."},{"family":"Sansevero","given":"Jerônimo B.

These are as follows: the time elapsed since restoration began, disturbance type and landscape context.

We contrasted 17 generalized linear models measuring forest cover at different landscape sizes (with buffers varying from 5 to 200 km radii). We identified the most plausible model to predict and map landscape variation in forest restoration success. We then weighted landscape variation by the amount of potentially restorable areas (agriculture and pasture land areas) within the same landscape.

  {"id":"crouzeillesWhichLandscapeSize2016","abstract":"Landscape context is a strong predictor of species persistence, abundance and distribution, yet its influence on the success of ecological restoration remains unclear. Thus, a primary question arises: which landscape size best predicts the effects of forest cover on restoration success? To answer this question, we conducted a global meta-analysis for biodiversity (mammals, birds, invertebrates, herpetofauna and plants) and measures of vegetation structure (cover, density, height, biomass and litter). Response ratios were calculated for comparisons between reference (e.g. old-growth forest) and disturbed sites (degraded or restored). Using an information-theoretic approach, mean response ratio (restoration success) and response ratio variance (restoration predictability) within each study landscape were regressed against the percentage of overall (summed forest cover) and contiguous (summed pixels of ≥60% forest cover) forest within eight different buffer sizes of radius 5–200 km (at 1-km resolution). We included 247 studies encompassing 196 study landscapes and 4360 quantitative comparisons. The best buffer (landscape) size varied for the following: (i) overall and contiguous forest cover, (ii) biodiversity and vegetation structure and (iii) mean response ratio and response ratio variance. Only plant biodiversity was influenced by overall forest cover (buffer size of 5, 10 and 200 km radii), while plants (10 and 200 km radii), mammals (5, 10 and 50–200 km radii), invertebrates (5 and 10 km radii), cover (5 km radii), height (5 km radii) and litter (100 km radii) were influenced by contiguous forest cover. Overall, mean response ratio and response ratio variance were positively and negatively nonlinearly related with both overall and contiguous forest cover, respectively. We reveal for the first time a clear pattern of increasing restoration success and decreasing uncertainty as contiguous forest cover increases. We also indicate preliminary recommended buffer sizes for investigating landscape restoration effects on biodiversity and vegetation structure. However, the coarse grain and variability in the data mean the optimal landscape size may not have been detected; thus, further research is needed. Synthesis and applications. When setting targets for ecological restoration, policymakers and restoration practitioners should account for the following: (i) the landscape context, particularly the amount of contiguous habitat up to 10 km around a disturbed site, and (ii) the uncertainty in restoration success, as it increases when contiguous forest cover falls below about 50%.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Crouzeilles","given":"Renato"},{"family":"Curran","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"crouzeillesWhichLandscapeSize2016","container-title":"Journal of Applied Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/1365-2664.12590","ISSN":"1365-2664","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2015 The Authors.

  {"id":"cubinaEffectDistanceForest2001","abstract":"Although lack of seeds can limit forest recovery in abandoned agricultural lands, few studies have documented the patterns of seed rain and soil seed bank in active pastures. To determine if lack of seeds is a limiting factor, we studied the woody species composition of the seed rain and soil seed bank in an active pasture in Barranquitas, Puerto Rico. In addition, fruit production of 43 common shrub and tree species was monitored in the surrounding secondary forest. Seed rain was monitored for one year at -2, 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 m from the forest edge along six transects. The soil seed bank was sampled in JanuarylFebruary 1995 and October/November 1995 at the same distances from the forest edge along ten transects. Of the 35 species that produced fruits in the forest, 14 species were detected in the seed rain study and only 0.3 percent of the seeds and 3 species dispersed to more than 4 m from the forest edge. Two of the three species were dispersed by wind. The seed bank study showed a similar pattern with a dramatic decrease in seedling density and species richness with distance from the forest edge. More than 50 percent of the seedlings in the seed bank study were Eema lamarckianum. This srudy demonstrated that few seeds disperse into the pastures and even when a rare dispersal event occurs, species do not accumulate because of short-term seed viability and, possibly, high seed predation. Studies of early secondary forest regeneration have shown that in some cases, forest can recover rapidly in abandoned agricultural lands; but our results suggest that only a small subset of the forest species will contribute to the initial recovery process.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Cubina","given":"Alejandro"},{"family":"Aide","given":"T.

  {"id":"cunhaDirectEvidencePhosphorus2022","abstract":"The productivity of rainforests growing on highly weathered tropical soils is expected to be limited by phosphorus availability1. Yet, controlled fertilization experiments have been unable to demonstrate a dominant role for phosphorus in controlling tropical forest net primary productivity. Recent syntheses have demonstrated that responses to nitrogen addition are as large as to phosphorus2, and adaptations to low phosphorus availability appear to enable net primary productivity to be maintained across major soil phosphorus gradients3. Thus, the extent to which phosphorus availability limits tropical forest productivity is highly uncertain. The majority of the Amazonia, however, is characterized by soils that are more depleted in phosphorus than those in which most tropical fertilization experiments have taken place2. Thus, we established a phosphorus, nitrogen and base cation addition experiment in an old growth Amazon rainforest, with a low soil phosphorus content that is representative of approximately 60% of the Amazon basin. Here we show that net primary productivity increased exclusively with phosphorus addition. After 2 years, strong responses were observed in fine root (+29%) and canopy productivity (+19%), but not stem growth. The direct evidence of phosphorus limitation of net primary productivity suggests that phosphorus availability may restrict Amazon forest responses to CO2 fertilization4, with major implications for future carbon sequestration and forest resilience to climate change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Cunha","given":"Hellen Fernanda Viana"},{"family":"Andersen","given":"Kelly M."},{"family":"Lugli","given":"Laynara Figueiredo"},{"family":"Santana","given":"Flavia Delgado"},{"family":"Aleixo","given":"Izabela Fonseca"},{"family":"Moraes","given":"Anna Martins"},{"family":"Garcia","given":"Sabrina"},{"family":"Di Ponzio","given":"Raffaello"},{"family":"Mendoza","given":"Erick Oblitas"},{"family":"Brum","given":"Bárbara"},{"family":"Rosa","given":"Jéssica Schmeisk"},{"family":"Cordeiro","given":"Amanda L."},{"family":"Portela","given":"Bruno Takeshi Tanaka"},{"family":"Ribeiro","given":"Gyovanni"},{"family":"Coelho","given":"Sara Deambrozi"},{"family":"Souza","given":"Sheila Trierveiler","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Silva","given":"Lara Siebert"},{"family":"Antonieto","given":"Felipe"},{"family":"Pires","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Salomão","given":"Ana Cláudia"},{"family":"Miron","given":"Ana Caroline"},{"family":"Assis","given":"Rafael L.","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Domingues","given":"Tomas F."},{"family":"Aragão","given":"Luiz E.

  {"id":"cushmanSmallFieldPlots2023","abstract":"Emerging satellite radar and lidar platforms are being developed to produce gridded aboveground biomass (AGB) predictions that are poised to expand our understanding of global carbon stocks and changes. However, the spatial resolution of AGB map products from these platforms is often larger than the available field plot data underpinning model calibration and validation efforts. Intermediate-resolution/extent remotely sensed data, like airborne lidar, can serve as a bridge between small plots and map resolution, but methods are needed to estimate and propagate uncertainties with multiple layers of data. Here, we introduce a workflow to estimate the pixel-level mean and variance in AGB maps by propagating uncertainty from a lidar-based model using small plots, taking into account prediction uncertainty, residual uncertainty, and residual spatial autocorrelation. We apply this workflow to estimate AGB uncertainty at a 100 m map resolution (1 ha pixels) using 0.04 ha field plots from 11 sites across four ecoregions. We compare uncertainty estimates using site-specific models, ecoregion-specific models, and a general model using all sites. The estimated AGB uncertainty for 1 ha pixels increased with mean AGB, reaching 7.8–33.3 Mg ha−1 for site-specific models (one standard deviation), 11.1–28.2 Mg ha−1 for ecoregion-specific models, and 21.1–22.1 Mg ha−1 for the general model for pixels in the AGB range of 80–100 Mg ha−1. Only 3 of 11 site-specific models had a total uncertainty of <15 Mg ha−1 in this biomass range, suitable for the calibration or validation of AGB map products. Using two additional sites with larger field plots, we show that lidar-based models calibrated with larger field plots can substantially reduce 1 ha pixel AGB uncertainty for the same range from 18.2 Mg ha−1 using 0.04 ha plots to 10.9 Mg ha−1 using 0.25 ha plots and 10.1 Mg ha−1 using 1 ha plots. We conclude that the estimated AGB uncertainty from models estimated from small field plots may be unacceptably large, and we recommend coordinated efforts to measure larger field plots as reference data for the calibration or validation of satellite-based map products at landscape scales (≥0.25 ha).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Cushman","given":"K.

  {"id":"dalagnolLargescaleVariationsDynamics2021","abstract":"Abstract\n            We report large-scale estimates of Amazonian gap dynamics using a novel approach with large datasets of airborne light detection and ranging (lidar), including five multi-temporal and 610 single-date lidar datasets. Specifically, we (1) compared the fixed height and relative height methods for gap delineation and established a relationship between static and dynamic gaps (newly created gaps); (2) explored potential environmental/climate drivers explaining gap occurrence using generalized linear models; and (3) cross-related our findings to mortality estimates from 181 field plots. Our findings suggest that static gaps are significantly correlated to dynamic gaps and can inform about structural changes in the forest canopy. Moreover, the relative height outperformed the fixed height method for gap delineation. Well-defined and consistent spatial patterns of dynamic gaps were found over the Amazon, while also revealing the dynamics of areas never sampled in the field. The predominant pattern indicates 20–35% higher gap dynamics at the west and southeast than at the central-east and north. These estimates were notably consistent with field mortality patterns, but they showed 60% lower magnitude likely due to the predominant detection of the broken/uprooted mode of death. While topographic predictors did not explain gap occurrence, the water deficit, soil fertility, forest flooding and degradation were key drivers of gap variability at the regional scale. These findings highlight the importance of lidar in providing opportunities for large-scale gap dynamics and tree mortality monitoring over the Amazon.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Dalagnol","given":"Ricardo"},{"family":"Wagner","given":"Fabien H."},{"family":"Galvão","given":"Lênio S."},{"family":"Streher","given":"Annia S."},{"family":"Phillips","given":"Oliver L."},{"family":"Gloor","given":"Emanuel"},{"family":"Pugh","given":"Thomas A.

  {"id":"dalagnolMappingTropicalForest2023","abstract":"Tropical rainforests from the Brazilian Amazon are frequently degraded by logging, fire, edge effects and minor unpaved roads. However, mapping the extent of degradation remains challenging because of the lack of frequent high-spatial resolution satellite observations, occlusion of understory disturbances, quick recovery of leafy vegetation, and limitations of conventional reflectance-based remote sensing techniques. Here, we introduce a new approach to map forest degradation caused by logging, fire, and road construction based on deep learning (DL), henceforth called DL-DEGRAD, using very high spatial (4.77 m) and bi-annual to monthly temporal resolution of the Planet NICFI imagery. We applied DL-DEGRAD model over forests of the state of Mato Grosso in Brazil to map forest degradation with attributions from 2016 to 2021 at six-month intervals. A total of 73,744 images (256 × 256 pixels in size) were visually interpreted and manually labeled with three semantic classes (logging, fire, and roads) to train/validate a U-Net model. We predicted the three classes over the study area for all dates, producing accumulated degradation maps biannually. Estimates of accuracy and areas of degradation were performed using a probability design-based stratified random sampling approach (n = 2678 samples) and compared it with existing operational data products at the state level. DL-DEGRAD performed significantly better than all other data products in mapping logging activities (F1-score = 68.9) and forest fire (F1-score = 75.6) when compared with the Brazil's national maps (SIMEX, DETER, MapBiomas Fire) and global products (UMD-GFC, TMF, FireCCI, FireGFL, GABAM, MCD64). Pixel-based spatial comparison of degradation areas showed the highest agreement with DETER and SIMEX as Brazil official data products derived from visual interpretation of Landsat imagery. The U-Net model applied to NICFI data performed as closely to a trained human delineation of logged and burned forests, suggesting the methodology can readily scale up the mapping and monitoring of degraded forests at national to regional scales. Over the state of Mato Grosso, the combined effects of logging and fire are degrading the remaining intact forests at an average rate of 8443 km2 year−1 from 2017 to 2021. In 2020, a record degradation area of 13,294 km2 was estimated from DL-DEGRAD, which was two times the areas of deforestation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Dalagnol","given":"Ricardo"},{"family":"Wagner","given":"Fabien Hubert"},{"family":"Galvão","given":"Lênio Soares"},{"family":"Braga","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Osborn","given":"Fiona"},{"family":"Sagang","given":"Le Bienfaiteur"},{"family":"Conceição Bispo","given":"Polyanna","non-dropping-particle":"da"},{"family":"Payne","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Silva Junior","given":"Celso"},{"family":"Favrichon","given":"Samuel"},{"family":"Silgueiro","given":"Vinicius"},{"family":"Anderson","given":"Liana O."},{"family":"Aragão","given":"Luiz Eduardo Oliveira e Cruz","dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Fensholt","given":"Rasmus"},{"family":"Brandt","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Ciais","given":"Philipe"},{"family":"Saatchi","given":"Sassan"}],"citation-key":"dalagnolMappingTropicalForest2023","container-title":"Remote Sensing of Environment","container-title-short":"Remote Sensing of Environment","DOI":"10.1016/j.rse.2023.113798","ISSN":"0034-4257","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,1]]},"page":"113798","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Mapping tropical forest degradation with deep learning and Planet NICFI data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425723003498","volume":"298"},

Although tropical biome distribution has traditionally been explained by climate and soil, contrasting vegetation types often occur as mosaics with sharp boundaries under very similar environmental conditions. While evidence suggests that these biomes are alternative states, empirical broad-scale support to this hypothesis is still lacking. Using community-level ﬁeld data and a novel resource-niche overlap approach, we show that, for a wide range of environmental conditions, ﬁre feedbacks maintain savannas and forests as alternative biome states in both the Neotropics and the Afrotropics. In addition, wooded grasslands and savannas occurred as alternative grassy states in the Afrotropics, depending on the relative importance of ﬁre and herbivory feedbacks. These results are consistent with landscape scale evidence and suggest that disturbance is a general factor driving and maintaining alternative biome states and vegetation mosaics in the tropics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Dantas","given":"Vinícius De L."},{"family":"Hirota","given":"Marina"},{"family":"Oliveira","given":"Rafael S."},{"family":"Pausas","given":"Juli G."}],"citation-key":"dantasDisturbanceMaintainsAlternative2016","container-title":"Ecology Letters","container-title-short":"Ecol Lett","DOI":"10.1111/ele.12537","editor":[{"family":"Rejmanek","given":"Marcel"}],"ISSN":"1461023X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",1]]},"language":"en","page":"12-19","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Disturbance maintains alternative biome states","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.12537","volume":"19"},

While numerous researchers around the world use a great variety of models to understand ecological dynamics and their responses to disturbances, only a small fraction of these models are ever used to inform ecosystem management. There seems to be a perception that ecological models are not useful for management, even though mathematical models are indispensable in many other fields. We were curious about this mismatch, its roots, and potential ways to overcome it. We searched the literature on recommendations and best practices for how to make ecological models useful to the management of ecosystems and we searched for ‘success stories’ from the past. We selected and examined several cases where models were instrumental in ecosystem management. We documented their success and asked whether and to what extent they followed recommended best practices. We found that there is not a unique way to conduct a research project that is useful in management decisions. While research is more likely to have impact when conducted with many stakeholders involved and specific to a situation for which data are available, there are great examples of small groups or individuals conducting highly influential research even in the absence of detailed data. We put the question of modelling for ecosystem management into a socio-economic and national context and give our perspectives on how the discipline could move forward.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,2]]},"author":[{"family":"DeAngelis","given":"Donald L."},{"family":"Franco","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Hastings","given":"Alan"},{"family":"Hilker","given":"Frank M."},{"family":"Lenhart","given":"Suzanne"},{"family":"Lutscher","given":"Frithjof"},{"family":"Petrovskaya","given":"Natalia"},{"family":"Petrovskii","given":"Sergei"},{"family":"Tyson","given":"Rebecca C."}],"citation-key":"deangelisBuildingSustainableFuture2021","container-title":"Bulletin of Mathematical Biology","container-title-short":"Bull Math Biol","DOI":"10.1007/s11538-021-00927-y","ISSN":"1522-9602","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,4]]},"language":"en","page":"107","source":"Springer Link","title":"Towards Building a Sustainable Future: Positioning Ecological Modelling for Impact in Ecosystems Management","title-short":"Towards Building a Sustainable Future","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11538-021-00927-y","volume":"83"},

In the present study these conclusions are verified analytically for general ecosystem models.

  {"id":"defariaModelBasedEstimationAmazonian2020","abstract":"In recent decades, droughts, deforestation and wildﬁres have become recurring phenomena that have heavily affected both human activities and natural ecosystems in Amazonia. The time needed for an ecosystem to recover from carbon losses is a crucial metric to evaluate disturbance impacts on forests. However, little is known about the impacts of these disturbances, alone and synergistically, on forest recovery time and the resulting spatiotemporal patterns at the regional scale. In this study, we combined the 3-PG forest growth model, remote sensing and ﬁeld derived equations, to map the Amazonia-wide (3 km of spatial resolution) impact and recovery time of aboveground biomass (AGB) after drought, ﬁre and a combination of logging and ﬁre. Our results indicate that AGB decreases by 4%, 19% and 46% in forests affected by drought, ﬁre and logging + ﬁre, respectively, with an average AGB recovery time of 27 years for drought, 44 years for burned and 63 years for logged + burned areas and with maximum values reaching 184 years in areas of high ﬁre intensity. Our ﬁndings provide two major insights in the spatial and temporal patterns of drought and wildﬁre in the Amazon: (1) the recovery time of the forests takes longer in the southeastern part of the basin, and, (2) as droughts and wildﬁres become more frequent—since the intervals between the disturbances are getting shorter than the rate of forest regeneration—the long lasting damage they cause potentially results in a permanent and increasing carbon losses from these fragile ecosystems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,18]]},"author":[{"family":"De Faria","given":"Bruno L."},{"family":"Marano","given":"Gina"},{"family":"Piponiot","given":"Camille"},{"family":"Silva","given":"Carlos A."},{"family":"Dantas","given":"Vinícius de L."},{"family":"Rattis","given":"Ludmila"},{"family":"Rech","given":"Andre R."},{"family":"Collalti","given":"Alessio"}],"citation-key":"defariaModelBasedEstimationAmazonian2020","container-title":"Forests","container-title-short":"Forests","DOI":"10.3390/f12010008","ISSN":"1999-4907","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,23]]},"language":"en","page":"8","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Model-Based Estimation of Amazonian Forests Recovery Time after Drought and Fire Events","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/12/1/8","volume":"12"},
  {"id":"dejesuscrespoLinkingWetlandEcosystem2019","abstract":"Mosquito-borne diseases are an increasingly important health concern, which pose great challenges for safe and sustainable control and eradication. This reality calls for management approaches that consider multiple aspects of the transmission cycle from a landscape and vector ecology perspective, to socio-economic elements that may increase exposure. This study seeks to better understand these pathways using dengue fever in the San Juan Bay Estuary (SJBE), Puerto Rico. Dengue is transmitted by Aedes aegypti, a species that thrives in cities. Here we ask which elements within the urban landscape could be managed to help prevent dengue outbreaks. We studied the potential of coastal wetlands in the SJBE to buffer vector proliferation, hypothesizing that wetland ecosystem services lead to lower dengue occurrence. We test this hypothesis using census-block level dengue data from 2010-13, including the largest epidemic in Puerto Rican history. Our analytical model includes socio-economic factors and environmental controls that may also affect dengue dynamics. Results from beta-binomial regressions and model averaging indicated that dengue occurrence was lower in neighborhoods with higher wetland cover even after controlling for population density and other socio-economic aspects. Our models suggest that heat hazard mitigation is partly responsible for the association between wetlands and dengue.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"De Jesús Crespo","given":"Rebeca"},{"family":"Méndez Lázaro","given":"Pablo"},{"family":"Yee","given":"Susan H."}],"citation-key":"dejesuscrespoLinkingWetlandEcosystem2019","container-title":"Wetlands","container-title-short":"Wetlands","DOI":"10.1007/s13157-017-0990-5","ISSN":"0277-5212, 1943-6246","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",12]]},"language":"en","page":"1281-1293","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Linking Wetland Ecosystem Services to Vector-borne Disease: Dengue Fever in the San Juan Bay Estuary, Puerto Rico","title-short":"Linking Wetland Ecosystem Services to Vector-borne Disease","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s13157-017-0990-5","volume":"39"},
  {"id":"delacruz-amoTradeOffsAbovegroundBelowground2020","abstract":"Tropical montane forests (TMFs) play an important role as a carbon reservoir at a global scale. However, there is a lack of a comprehensive understanding on the variation in carbon storage across TMF compartments [namely aboveground biomass (AGB), belowground biomass (BGB), and soil organic matter] along altitudinal and environmental gradients and their potential trade-offs. This study aims to: 1) understand how carbon stocks vary along altitudinal gradients in Andean TMFs, and; 2) determine the influence of climate, particularly precipitation seasonality, on the distribution of carbon stocks across different forest compartments. The study was conducted in sixty 0.1 ha plots along two altitudinal gradients at the Podocarpus National Park (Ecuador) and Río Abiseo National Park (Peru). At each plot, we calculated the amount of carbon in AGB (i.e. aboveground carbon stock, AGC), BGB (i.e. belowground carbon stock, BGC), and soil organic matter (i.e. soil organic carbon stock, SOC). The mean total carbon stock was 244.76 ± 80.38 Mg ha–1 and 211.51 ± 46.95 Mg ha–1 in the Ecuadorian and Peruvian plots, respectively. Although AGC, BGC, and SOC showed different partitioning patterns along the altitudinal gradient both in Ecuador and Peru, total carbon stock did not change with altitude in either site. The combination of annual mean temperature and precipitation seasonality explained differences in the observed patterns of carbon stocks across forest compartments between the two sites. This study suggests that the greater precipitation seasonality of colder, higher altitudes may promote faster turnover rates of organic matter and nutrients and, consequently, less accumulation of SOC but greater AGC and BGC, compared to those sites with lesser precipitation seasonality. Our results demonstrate the capacity of TMFs to store substantial amounts of carbon and suggest the existence of a trade-off in carbon stocks among forest compartments, which could be partly driven by differences in precipitation seasonality, especially under the colder temperatures of high altitudes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Cruz-Amo","given":"Lydia","non-dropping-particle":"de la"},{"family":"Bañares-de-Dios","given":"Guillermo"},{"family":"Cala","given":"Victoria"},{"family":"Granzow-de la Cerda","given":"Íñigo"},{"family":"Espinosa","given":"Carlos I."},{"family":"Ledo","given":"Alicia"},{"family":"Salinas","given":"Norma"},{"family":"Macía","given":"Manuel J."},{"family":"Cayuela","given":"Luis"}],"citation-key":"delacruz-amoTradeOffsAbovegroundBelowground2020","container-title":"Frontiers in Plant Science","ISSN":"1664-462X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"source":"Frontiers","title":"Trade-Offs Among Aboveground, Belowground, and Soil Organic Carbon Stocks Along Altitudinal Gradients in Andean Tropical Montane Forests","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2020.00106","volume":"11"},

About 65% of all species and 82% of endemic species are classified as threatened. We rediscovered five species classified as Extinct on the IUCN Red List and identified 13 endemics as possibly extinct.

  {"id":"delimaGiantsAmazonHow2023","abstract":"For more than three decades, major efforts in sampling and analyzing tree diversity in South America have focused almost exclusively on trees with stems of at least 10 and 2.5 cm diameter, showing highest species diversity in the wetter western and northern Amazon forests. By contrast, little attention has been paid to patterns and drivers of diversity in the largest canopy and emergent trees, which is surprising given these have dominant ecological functions. Here, we use a machine learning approach to quantify the importance of environmental factors and apply it to generate spatial predictions of the species diversity of all trees (dbh ≥ 10 cm) and for very large trees (dbh ≥ 70 cm) using data from 243 forest plots (108,450 trees and 2832 species) distributed across different forest types and biogeographic regions of the Brazilian Amazon. The diversity of large trees and of all trees was significantly associated with three environmental factors, but in contrasting ways across regions and forest types. Environmental variables associated with disturbances, for example, the lightning flash rate and wind speed, as well as the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation, tend to govern the diversity of large trees. Upland rainforests in the Guiana Shield and Roraima regions had a high diversity of large trees. By contrast, variables associated with resources tend to govern tree diversity in general. Places such as the province of Imeri and the northern portion of the province of Madeira stand out for their high diversity of species in general. Climatic and topographic stability and functional adaptation mechanisms promote ideal conditions for species diversity. Finally, we mapped general patterns of tree species diversity in the Brazilian Amazon, which differ substantially depending on size class.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"De Lima","given":"Robson Borges"},{"family":"Görgens","given":"Eric Bastos"},{"family":"Da Silva","given":"Diego Armando S."},{"family":"De Oliveira","given":"Cinthia Pereira"},{"family":"Batista","given":"Anderson Pedro B."},{"family":"Caraciolo Ferreira","given":"Rinaldo L."},{"family":"Costa","given":"Flavia R.

We investigated whether harpy eagles (\n              Harpia harpyja\n              ) in Amazonian Forests—a typically low soil fertility ecosystem—affect soil nutrient profiles and the phytochemistry around their nest-trees through cumulative deposition of prey carcasses and excreta.

Effects of nests were surprisingly negative over local soil nutrient profiles, with soils underneath nest-trees showing reductions in nutrients compared with controls. Conversely, canopy tree leaves around nests showed significant 99%, 154% and 50% increases in nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, respectively. Harpy eagles have experienced a 41% decline in their range, and many raptor species are becoming locally extirpated. These are general examples of disruption in biogeochemical cycles and nutrient heterogeneity caused by population declines in a central-place apex predator.

  {"id":"dentFutureTropicalSpecies2009","abstract":"Deforestation and degradation of tropical old-growth forests has the potential to cause catastrophic species extinctions. In this review, we assess whether regenerating secondary forests (SF) can support species typically found in old-growth forest (OG) and so prevent extinctions. We review 65 studies that compare faunal diversity in SF and corresponding OG, and compare the similarity of species composition both within and between these two forest types using the Sorensen, Morisita–Horn and Sorensen–Chao indices. Comparisons between traditional similarity indices and Sorensen–Chao, which minimizes sampling biases, indicated that limited sampling effort consistently reduced apparent similarity between SF and OG and that similarity between SF and OG is actually higher than previously appreciated. Similarity, which ranges from 0 to 1, varied from 0.49 to 0.92 between replicate OG sites and was correlated with similarity between SF and OG. This correlation might be an artefact of variation among studies in sampling effort, especially for vertebrates where small samples reduce apparent similarity across all comparisons, as well as a real effect of variation among studies in landscape heterogeneity and the presence of species with patchy distributions. Therefore, similarity between SF and OG cannot be interpreted without an understanding of background variation in OG. Similarity between different SF sites provided no evidence that disturbance specialists dominate SF. Similarity to OG increased rapidly with SF age; when SF was contiguous with OG; when SF was growing in small clearings; and after low intensity land uses including clearing only, shifting agriculture and tree plantations. This describes the most frequently observed tropical SF; isolated from roads and on hilly terrain unsuitable for mechanized agriculture. Thus, our analyses indicate that tropical SF can play an important role in biodiversity conservation particularly when OG forests are nearby. An important caveat remains, however. Abundance, geographic range and levels of habitat specialization are often related. Widespread, abundant, habitat generalists might dominate similarity analyses even when relatively rare OG specialists are present. Additional species-level analyses of habitat specialization will be needed before the conservation value of tropical SF is fully understood.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Dent","given":"Daisy H."},{"family":"Joseph Wright","given":"S."}],"citation-key":"dentFutureTropicalSpecies2009","container-title":"Biological Conservation","container-title-short":"Biological Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/j.biocon.2009.05.035","ISSN":"0006-3207","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",12,1]]},"page":"2833-2843","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The future of tropical species in secondary forests: A quantitative review","title-short":"The future of tropical species in secondary forests","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320709002535","volume":"142"},
  {"id":"dentSecondaryForestsCentral2013","abstract":"Question: Does species and functional composition of secondary tropical forests more closely follow a deterministic or a stochastic model of succession? Location: The Barro Colorado Nature Monument (BCNM), central Panama. The BCNM comprises Barro Colorado Island (BCI) and five adjacent mainland peninsulas and is a mosaic of tropical old-growth (OG) and secondary forests (SF). Methods: We studied the species and functional composition of seedling, sapling and adult tree communities in a chronosequence of SF stands ranging in age from 20 to 100 yrs since abandonment, as well as two OG stands for comparison. Functional composition was defined as the representation of species with different degrees of shade tolerance. We also examined patterns of species diversity and dominance to better understand processes driving compositional changes. Results: Species diversity recovered rapidly, and, by 20 yrs, species richness for all size classes was equivalent if not higher in SF compared to OG. Species diversity tended to be lower and species dominance higher for seedlings than saplings or adults. Seedling, sapling and adult tree species composition did not clearly increase in similarity to OG with forest age. Instead, differences in species composition among stands reflected variation in dominance by particular species. Light-demanding species became less common and shade-tolerant species more common over stand age, with the functional composition of older secondary forests converging on that of OG. The seedling and sapling communities across the chronosequence were composed of a shade-tolerant subset of those species found in the stands as adults. Conclusion: Our results suggest that recruitment into the seedling community of SF is determined by both predictable (e.g. selection for shade-tolerant species) and unpredictable factors (e.g. species-specific reproduction events and dispersal limitation). Recruitment into the sapling and tree communities reflects stronger, and potentially compounded, selection for shade-tolerant species. Therefore, changes in the species composition of regenerating forests in this area appear to be unpredictable, even though the functional composition follows a more deterministic and predictable trajectory with convergence on OG over time. © 2012 International Association for Vegetation Science.","author":[{"family":"Dent","given":"Daisy H."},{"family":"Dewalt","given":"Saara J."},{"family":"Denslow","given":"Julie S."}],"citation-key":"dentSecondaryForestsCentral2013","container-title":"J.

Based on this gap, we assessed the ecological outcomes and local livelihood benefits of community-managed agroforests and second growth forests to assist natural regeneration in the coastal Atlantic Forest of Brazil. We investigated and compared agroforests and secondary forests according to their structure and floristic composition in 51 circular plots of 314 m², their role in supporting local livelihoods (45 semi-structured interviews) and the use and cultural importance of plant species (61 interviews). Agroforests and, more remarkably, managed secondary forests (1) re-established a well-developed forest structure, with a higher density of tree-sized individuals and similar basal area compared to nearby old growth forests; (2) were composed by a rich array of native species, including five threatened species, but had lower species richness than old growth remnants; and (3) improved local livelihoods by supplying market valuable and culturally important plants, including 231 native ethnospecies. Overall, local production systems showed remarkable potential to engage smallholders of developing tropical countries in Forest and Landscape Restoration and contribute to achieve its overall goals. We advocate the promotion of these systems as effective Forest and Landscape Restoration approaches in multi-scale programs and policies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Souza","given":"Saulo E.

  {"id":"dieterPhosphorusFractionationLowland2010","abstract":"Phosphorus availability is commonly assumed to limit productivity in lowland tropical rainforests, yet there is relatively little information on the chemical forms of soil phosphorus in such ecosystems. We used the Hedley sequential fractionation scheme to assess phosphorus chemistry in ﬁve soils supporting tropical rainforest on Barro Colorado Island, Republic of Panama. The soils represented a range of orders (Inceptisols, Alﬁsols, and Oxisols) formed on contrasting geological substrates and topography, but under uniform climate and vegetation. Total phosphorus in surface horizons ranged between 315 and 1114 mg P kg− 1, being lowest on a soil derived from marine sediments and highest on soils derived from andesite. The majority of the phosphorus occurred in recalcitrant forms, although between 14% and 39% occurred as organic phosphorus. Readily-available phosphate, as extracted by anion-exchange membranes, occurred in small concentrations (4–13 mg P kg− 1), although labile phosphorus, deﬁned as phosphate extracted by anion-exchange membrane plus inorganic and organic phosphorus extracted by 0.5 M NaHCO3, accounted for between 4.7% and 11.4% of the total soil phosphorus. Our results indicate a strong control of geology and topography on soil phosphorus in tropical rainforests, which may have important implications for understanding the diversity and distribution of plant species in such ecosystems. Further, some of the most common soils on Barro Colorado Island, including those on the 50 ha forest dynamics plot, are rich in phosphorus despite their relatively advanced stage of pedogenesis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Dieter","given":"Daniela"},{"family":"Elsenbeer","given":"Helmut"},{"family":"Turner","given":"Benjamin L."}],"citation-key":"dieterPhosphorusFractionationLowland2010","container-title":"CATENA","container-title-short":"CATENA","DOI":"10.1016/j.catena.2010.05.010","ISSN":"03418162","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",8]]},"language":"en","page":"118-125","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Phosphorus fractionation in lowland tropical rainforest soils in central Panama","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0341816210000755","volume":"82"},
  {"id":"disaccoTenGoldenRules2021","abstract":"Urgent solutions to global climate change are needed. Ambitious tree-planting initiatives, many already underway, aim to sequester enormous quantities of carbon to partly compensate for anthropogenic CO2 emissions, which are a major cause of rising global temperatures. However, tree planting that is poorly planned and executed could actually increase CO2 emissions and have long-term, deleterious impacts on biodiversity, landscapes and livelihoods. Here, we highlight the main environmental risks of large-scale tree planting and propose 10 golden rules, based on some of the most recent ecological research, to implement forest ecosystem restoration that maximizes rates of both carbon sequestration and biodiversity recovery while improving livelihoods. These are as follows: (1) Protect existing forest first; (2) Work together (involving all stakeholders); (3) Aim to maximize biodiversity recovery to meet multiple goals; (4) Select appropriate areas for restoration; (5) Use natural regeneration wherever possible; (6) Select species to maximize biodiversity; (7) Use resilient plant material (with appropriate genetic variability and provenance); (8) Plan ahead for infrastructure, capacity and seed supply; (9) Learn by doing (using an adaptive management approach); and (10) Make it pay (ensuring the economic sustainability of the project). We focus on the design of long-term strategies to tackle the climate and biodiversity crises and support livelihood needs. We emphasize the role of local communities as sources of indigenous knowledge, and the benefits they could derive from successful reforestation that restores ecosystem functioning and delivers a diverse range of forest products and services. While there is no simple and universal recipe for forest restoration, it is crucial to build upon the currently growing public and private interest in this topic, to ensure interventions provide effective, long-term carbon sinks and maximize benefits for biodiversity and people.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Di Sacco","given":"Alice"},{"family":"Hardwick","given":"Kate A."},{"family":"Blakesley","given":"David"},{"family":"Brancalion","given":"Pedro H.

An accounting of relative accuracy and errors among lidar platforms within a range of forest types and structural configurations was needed. Within a ponderosa pine forest in northern Arizona, we compare vegetation attributes at the tree-, plot-, and stand-scales derived from three lidar platforms: fixed-wing airborne (ALS), fixed-location terrestrial (TLS), and hand-held mobile laser scanning (MLS). We present a methodology to segment individual trees from TLS and MLS datasets, incorporating eigen-value and density metrics to locate trees, then as-signing point returns to trees using a graph-theory shortest-path approach. Overall, we found MLS consistently provided more accurate structural metrics at the tree-(e.g., mean absolute error for DBH in cm was 4.8, 5.0, and 9.1 for MLS, TLS and ALS, respectively) and plot-scale (e.g., R2 for field observed and lidar-derived basal area, m2 ha−1, was 0.986, 0.974, and 0.851 for MLS, TLS, and ALS, respectively) as compared to ALS and TLS. While TLS data produced estimates similar to MLS, attributes derived from TLS often underpredicted structural values due to occlusion. Additionally, ALS data provided accurate estimates of tree height for larger trees, yet consistently missed and underpredicted small trees (≤35 cm). MLS produced accurate estimates of canopy cover and landscape metrics up to 50 m from plot center. TLS tended to underpredict both canopy cover and patch metrics with constant bias due to occlusion. Taking full advantage of minimal occlusion effects, MLS data consistently provided the best individual tree and plot-based metrics, with ALS providing the best estimates for volume, biomass, and canopy cover. Overall, we found MLS data logistically simple, quickly acquirable, and accurate for small area inventories, assessments, and monitoring activities.

  {"id":"donImpactTropicalLanduse2011","abstract":"Land-use changes are the second largest source of human-induced greenhouse gas emission, mainly due to deforestation in the tropics and subtropics. CO2 emissions result from biomass and soil organic carbon (SOC) losses and may be offset with afforestation programs. However, the effect of land-use changes on SOC is poorly quantified due to insufficient data quality (only SOC concentrations and no SOC stocks, shallow sampling depth) and representativeness. In a global meta-analysis, 385 studies on land-use change in the tropics were explored to estimate the SOC stock changes for all major land-use change types. The highest SOC losses were caused by conversion of primary forest into cropland (−25%) and perennial crops (−30%) but forest conversion into grassland also reduced SOC stocks by 12%. Secondary forests stored less SOC than primary forests (−9%) underlining the importance of primary forests for C stores. SOC losses are partly reversible if agricultural land is afforested (+29%) or under cropland fallow (+32%) and with cropland conversion into grassland (+26%). Data on soil bulk density are critical in order to estimate SOC stock changes because (i) the bulk density changes with land-use and needs to be accounted for when calculating SOC stocks and (ii) soil sample mass has to be corrected for bulk density changes in order to compare land-use types on the same basis of soil mass. Without soil mass correction, land-use change effects would have been underestimated by 28%. Land-use change impact on SOC was not restricted to the surface soil, but relative changes were equally high in the subsoil, stressing the importance of sufficiently deep sampling.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Don","given":"Axel"},{"family":"Schumacher","given":"Jens"},{"family":"Freibauer","given":"Annette"}],"citation-key":"donImpactTropicalLanduse2011","container-title":"Global Change Biology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-2486.2010.02336.x","ISSN":"1365-2486","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd","page":"1658-1670","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Impact of tropical land-use change on soil organic carbon stocks – a meta-analysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2010.02336.x","volume":"17"},

However, it remains unclear whether leaf temperatures experienced by tropical vegetation approach this threshold or soon will under climate change. Here we found that pantropical canopy temperatures independently triangulated from individual leaf thermocouples, pyrgeometers and remote sensing (ECOSTRESS) have midday peak temperatures of approximately 34 °C during dry periods, with a long high-temperature tail that can exceed 40 °C. Leaf thermocouple data from multiple sites across the tropics suggest that even within pixels of moderate temperatures, upper canopy leaves exceed Tcrit 0.01% of the time. Furthermore, upper canopy leaf warming experiments (+2, 3 and 4 °C in Brazil, Puerto Rico and Australia, respectively) increased leaf temperatures non-linearly, with peak leaf temperatures exceeding Tcrit 1.3% of the time (11% for more than 43.5 °C, and 0.3% for more than 49.9 °C). Using an empirical model incorporating these dynamics (validated with warming experiment data), we found that tropical forests can withstand up to a 3.9 ± 0.5 °C increase in air temperatures before a potential tipping point in metabolic function, but remaining uncertainty in the plasticity and range of Tcrit in tropical trees and the effect of leaf death on tree death could drastically change this prediction. The 4.0 °C estimate is within the ‘worst-case scenario’ (representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5) of climate change predictions2 for tropical forests and therefore it is still within our power to decide (for example, by not taking the RCP 6.0 or 8.5 route) the fate of these critical realms of carbon, water and biodiversity3,4.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Doughty","given":"Christopher E."},{"family":"Keany","given":"Jenna M."},{"family":"Wiebe","given":"Benjamin C."},{"family":"Rey-Sanchez","given":"Camilo"},{"family":"Carter","given":"Kelsey R."},{"family":"Middleby","given":"Kali B."},{"family":"Cheesman","given":"Alexander W."},{"family":"Goulden","given":"Michael L."},{"family":"Rocha","given":"Humberto R.","non-dropping-particle":"da"},{"family":"Miller","given":"Scott D."},{"family":"Malhi","given":"Yadvinder"},{"family":"Fauset","given":"Sophie"},{"family":"Gloor","given":"Emanuel"},{"family":"Slot","given":"Martijn"},{"family":"Oliveras Menor","given":"Imma"},{"family":"Crous","given":"Kristine Y."},{"family":"Goldsmith","given":"Gregory R."},{"family":"Fisher","given":"Joshua B."}],"citation-key":"doughtyTropicalForestsAre2023","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-023-06391-z","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7977","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",9]]},"language":"en","license":"2023 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","number":"7977","page":"105-111","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Tropical forests are approaching critical temperature thresholds","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06391-z","volume":"621"},

Across these sites, the direct influence of climate on microbiome composition and activity was relatively lower at depth. Furthermore, we found that certain microbial taxa change in relative abundance over large temperature and precipitation gradients only in specific soil horizons, highlighting the depth dependence of the climatic controls on microbiome composition.

Here, we investigated the effects of tree diversity on light interception over space and time in two tropical tree experiments, located in Panama—Sardinilla site (monocultures to 18-species mixtures), and in Brazil—Anhembi site (20- to 114-species mixtures). We assessed intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (iPAR) over horizontal grids and vertical transects (up to 5 m high in Sardinilla and up to 4 m high in Anhembi), in plots containing different richness levels and combinations of species. Light interception increased from monocultures to 5-species mixtures in Sardinilla and from 20- to 114-species mixtures in Anhembi (during the dry season). At the Sardinilla site, five-species mixtures showed iPAR comparable to the best performing monocultures, despite substantial differences observed among monocultures. Diversity-iPAR relationships changed seasonally and were more pronounced during the dry season. Tree richness promoted a less variable temporal and spatial (i.e. both horizontal and vertical) distribution of light interception. Synthesis. High tree diversity (i.e. over a hundred species in mixture) maximizes the amount of light intercepted by the canopy in restored tropical forests through more even capture in space and time. Diversity-light interception relationships should be critically considered for designing cost-efficient large-scale tropical forest restoration programs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Duarte","given":"Marina Melo"},{"family":"Moral","given":"Rafael de Andrade"},{"family":"Guillemot","given":"Joannès"},{"family":"Zuim","given":"Caroline Isaac Ferreira"},{"family":"Potvin","given":"Catherine"},{"family":"Bonat","given":"Wagner Hugo"},{"family":"Stape","given":"José Luiz"},{"family":"Brancalion","given":"Pedro H.

  {"id":"dubayahEstimationTropicalForest2010","abstract":"In this paper we present the results of an experiment to measure forest structure and biomass dynamics over the tropical forests of La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica using a medium resolution lidar. Our main objective was to observe changes in forest canopy height, related height metrics, and biomass, and from these map sources and sinks of carbon across the landscape. The Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS) measured canopy structure over La Selva in 1998 and again in 2005. Changes in waveform metrics were related to field-derived changes in estimated aboveground biomass from a series of old growth and secondary forest plots. Pairwise comparisons of nearly coincident lidar footprints between years showed canopy top height changes that coincided with expected changes based on land cover types. Old growth forests had a net loss in height of .0.33 m, while secondary forests had net gain of 2.08 m. Multiple linear regression was used to relate lidar metrics with biomass changes for combined old growth and secondary forest plots, giving an r2 of 0.65 and an RSE of 10.5 Mg/ha, but both parametric and bootstrapped confidence intervals were wide, suggesting weaker model performance. The plot level relationships were then used to map biomass changes across La Selva using LVIS at a 1 ha scale. The spatial patterns of biomass changes matched expected patterns given the distribution of land cover types at La Selva, with secondary forests showing a gain of 25 Mg/ha and old growth forests showing little change (2 Mg/ha). Prediction intervals were calculated to assess uncertainty for each 1 ha cell to ascertain whether the data and methods used could confidently estimate the sign (source or sink) of the biomass changes. The resulting map showed most of the old growth areas as neutral (no net biomass change), with widely scattered and isolated sources and sinks. Secondary forests in contrast were mostly sinks or neutral, but were never sources. By quantifying both the magnitude of biomass changes and the sensitivity of lidar to detect them, this work will help inform the formulation of future space missions focused on biomass dynamics, such as NASA's Deformation Ecosystem Structure and Dynamics of Ice mission.

In this version, the granules are in sub-orbits. The algorithm setting group selection used for GEDI02_A Version 2 has been modified for Evergreen Broadleaf Trees in South America to reduce false positive errors resulting from the selection of waveform modes above ground elevation as the lowest mode. The footprints are located within the global latitude band observed by the International Space Station (ISS), nominally 51.6 degrees N and S and reported for the period 2019-04-18 to 2023-03-16. The GEDI instrument consists of three lasers producing a total of eight beam ground transects, which instantaneously sample eight ~25 m footprints spaced approximately every 60 m along-track. The GEDI beam transects are spaced approximately 600 m apart on the Earth's surface in the cross-track direction, for an across-track width of ~4.2 km. Footprint AGBD was derived from parametric models that relate simulated GEDI Level 2A (L2A) waveform relative height (RH) metrics to field plot estimates of AGBD. Height metrics from simulated waveforms associated with field estimates of AGBD from multiple regions and plant functional types (PFTs) were compiled to generate a calibration dataset for models representing the combinations of world regions and PFTs (i.e., deciduous broadleaf trees, evergreen broadleaf trees, evergreen needleleaf trees, deciduous needleleaf trees, and the combination of grasslands, shrubs, and woodlands). For each of the eight beams, additional data are reported with the AGBD estimates, including the associated uncertainty metrics, quality flags, model inputs, and other information about the GEDI L2A waveform for this selected algorithm setting group. Model inputs include the scaled and transformed GEDI L2A RH metrics, footprint geolocation variables and land cover input data including PFTs and the world region identifiers. Additional model outputs include the AGBD predictions for each of the six GEDI L2A algorithm setting groups with AGBD in natural and transformed units and associated prediction uncertainty for each GEDI L2A algorithm setting group. Providing these ancillary data products will allow users to evaluate and select alternative algorithm setting groups.

Diabetes (4.2%) and obesity (3.2%) are still rare compared to occidental countries, but are already in the high range of rural prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa. Impacts of reforestation may have direct and indirect effects on human health: the choice of planted forests increases ecosystem services (food, commerce, health, etc.) and may therefore increases the availability of traditional medicine plants; furthermore, the Great Green Wall actions (creation of seasonal jobs, sale of vegetables produced in drip-irrigated gardens, of pasture grass…) have a direct impact on monetized local economy, by generating revenues that did not previously exist. To conclude, it should be noted that the increase in plant biodiversity and the increased availability of food plants and traditional medical treatments is likely to have an impact on human health (increase of traditional treatments for noncommunicable diseases, inclusion of more sources of potassium in food). Moreover, the ability to sell fruits, vegetables, and straw, generated through reforestation and associated actions will allow people to improve their standard of living.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Duboz","given":"Priscilla"},{"family":"Boëtsch","given":"Gilles"},{"family":"Guissé","given":"Aliou"},{"family":"Goffner","given":"Deborah"},{"family":"Peiry","given":"Jean-Luc"},{"family":"Sarr","given":"Papa"},{"family":"Macia","given":"Enguerran"}],"citation-key":"dubozReforestationStateHealth2019","container-title":"Regional Environmental Change","container-title-short":"Reg Environ Change","DOI":"10.1007/s10113-019-01467-x","ISSN":"1436-378X","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1643-1651","source":"Springer Link","title":"Reforestation and the state of health of populations in Tessekere, Senegal","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10113-019-01467-x","volume":"19"},

Surface soil (10 cm deep, 4.7 cm diameter) was collected at 10 m intervals along three 120-160 m long transects in each stand ( 4 4 4 8 soil cores, 22-24 combined seed bank samples per site). Seed density was highest but variable in second-growth stands (833114535 seeds/m2),low and homogeneom in old-growth stands (2258-2659 seeds/m2),and intermediate and highly variable in selectively-logged stands (1165-6854 seeds/m2), which also had contrasting logging intensities. Species richness was strongly dependent on seed density, but showed less variation. Life form distribution did not differ statistically among or within land-use categories. In each stand, herbs-forbs, shrubs, and vines dominated the seed bank (> 75% of the species richness and abundance), whereas trees were a minor component (< 20% of the species richness and < 5% of the abundance) and were predominantly early successional. Shrubs and vines were most abundant in second-growth stands where regrowth vegetation was repeatedly cut before abandonment, whereas grasses and sedges were most abundant in the only forest stand that was completelysurrounded by pastures. In terms of species composition, old-growth stands were more similar to selectively-logged stands than to second-growth stands, but across stands, selectively-logged forests were most distinct from the other two forest types. An inventory of the standing woody vegetation in each site showed little representation of the woody taxa found in the seed bank. We discuss these results in the context of the main factors that have been postulated to influence the abundance, life form, and species composition of tropical forest seed banks, and explore the role of the latter during intermediate phases of tropical forest succession and regeneration.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Dupuy","given":"Juan M."},{"family":"Chazdon","given":"Robin L."}],"citation-key":"dupuyLongTermEffectsForest1998","container-title":"Biotropica","container-title-short":"Biotropica","DOI":"10.1111/j.1744-7429.1998.tb00057.x","ISSN":"0006-3606, 1744-7429","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998",6]]},"language":"en","page":"223-237","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Long-Term Effects of Forest Regrowth and Selective Logging on the Seed Bank of Tropical Forests in NE Costa Rica1.","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1744-7429.1998.tb00057.x","volume":"30"},

We obtained 36 spectral readings, from the adaxial and abaxial surfaces of dried leaves, for 159 individuals representing 10 species. Each spectrum consisted of 1557 FT-NIR absorbance values. We compared the rate of correct specimen (individual tree) identification to species for different datasets and discriminant models, in which individual spectrum consisted of different combinations as to the number of variables (all, stepwise selected), different number of reads per specimen (all reads, adaxial, abaxial, randomly selected), and discriminant models (cross-validation, test set validation). The best results indicated 99.4% of correct specimen identification when we used the average of all 36 spectral readings per specimen and stepwise selected variables. The lowest rate was on average 96.6% when a single spectral reading was used per individual tree (randomly sampled over 100 replicates). Overall, the rate of correct species discrimination was always high and insensible to variable selection, to the different datasets, and to the two major validation models we used. These Species Spectral Signature (SSS) provided better results than current DNA barcoding for plant identification in tropical forests, and represents a fast, low-cost sampling technique. Although further tests are required to assess the potential of FT-NIR spectroscopy for plant identification at broader geographical and phylogenetic scales, the results presented in this paper indicate that SSS extracted from herbarium specimens can be a powerful reference to identify specimens, even when lacking reproductive structures, an so of particular interest for forest inventory and management.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Durgante","given":"Flávia Machado"},{"family":"Higuchi","given":"Niro"},{"family":"Almeida","given":"Ana"},{"family":"Vicentini","given":"Alberto"}],"citation-key":"durganteSpeciesSpectralSignature2013","container-title":"Forest Ecology and Management","container-title-short":"Forest Ecology and Management","DOI":"10.1016/j.foreco.2012.10.045","ISSN":"0378-1127","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",3,1]]},"page":"240-248","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Species Spectral Signature: Discriminating closely related plant species in the Amazon with Near-Infrared Leaf-Spectroscopy","title-short":"Species Spectral Signature","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112712006512","volume":"291"},

While numerous ecological studies have used simulated GEDI data, on-orbit constraint may limit ecological inference. This is the ﬁrst study that we are aware of that directly compares methods using simulated and on-orbit GEDI data. Simulated GEDI data showed that ﬁre effects varied nonlinearly through the canopy and then moved upward with time since burn. Given that ﬁre effects peaked in the mid-canopy and were often on the scale of 2 to 3 m in height difference, it is unlikely that on-orbit GEDI data will have the sensitivity to detect these same changes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"East","given":"Alyson"},{"family":"Hansen","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Armenteras","given":"Dolors"},{"family":"Jantz","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Roberts","given":"David W."}],"citation-key":"eastMeasuringUnderstoryFire2023","container-title":"Remote Sensing","container-title-short":"Remote Sensing","DOI":"10.3390/rs15030696","ISSN":"2072-4292","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,24]]},"language":"en","page":"696","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Measuring Understory Fire Effects from Space: Canopy Change in Response to Tropical Understory Fire and What This Means for Applications of GEDI to Tropical Forest Fire","title-short":"Measuring Understory Fire Effects from Space","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/15/3/696","volume":"15"},

  {"id":"elgarOvercomingBarriersSeedling2014","abstract":"Combating the legacy of deforestation on tropical biodiversity requires the conversion to forest of large areas of established pasture, where barriers to native plant regeneration include competition with pasture grasses and poor propagule supply (seed availability). In addition, initial woody plants that colonise pasture are often invasive, non-native species whose ecological roles and management in the context of forest regeneration are contested. In a restoration experiment at two 0.64 ha sites we quantiﬁed the response of native woody vegetation recruitment to (1) release from competition with introduced pasture grasses, and (2) local facilitation of frugivore-assisted seed dispersal provided by scattered woody plants and artiﬁcial bird perches. Herbicide pasture grass suppression during 20 months caused a signiﬁcant but modest increase in density of native woody seedlings, together with abundant co-recruitment of the prominent non-native pioneer wild tobacco (Solanum mauritianum). Recruitment of native species was further enhanced by local structure in herbicide-treated areas, being consistently greater under live trees and dead non-native shrubs (herbicide-treated) than in open areas, and intermediate under bird perches. Native seedling recruitment comprised 28 species across 0.25 ha sampled but was dominated by two rainforest pioneers (Homalanthus novoguineensis, Polyscias murrayi). These early results are consistent with the expected increase in woody vegetation recruitment in response to release from competitive and dispersive barriers to rainforest regeneration. The ﬁndings highlight the need for a pragmatic consideration of the ecological roles of woody weeds and the potential roles of “new forests” more broadly in accelerating succession of humid tropical forest across large areas of retired agricultural land.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Elgar","given":"Amelia T."},{"family":"Freebody","given":"Kylie"},{"family":"Pohlman","given":"Catherine L."},{"family":"Shoo","given":"Luke P."},{"family":"Catterall","given":"Carla P."}],"citation-key":"elgarOvercomingBarriersSeedling2014","container-title":"Frontiers in Plant Science","container-title-short":"Front.

  {"id":"eliasAssessingGrowthClimate2020","abstract":"Tropical forests hold 30% of Earth’s terrestrial carbon and at least 60% of its terrestrial biodiversity, but forest loss and degradation are jeopardizing these ecosystems. Although the regrowth of secondary forests has the potential to offset some of the losses of carbon and biodiversity, it remains unclear if secondary regeneration will be affected by climate changes such as higher temperatures and more frequent extreme droughts. We used a data set of 10 repeated forest inventories spanning two decades (1999–2017) to investigate carbon and tree species recovery and how climate and landscape context influence carbon dynamics in an older secondary forest located in one of the oldest post-Columbian agricultural frontiers in the Brazilian Amazon. Carbon accumulation averaged 1.08 Mg·ha−1·yr−1, and species richness was effectively constant over the studied period. Moreover, we provide evidence that secondary forests are vulnerable to drought stress: Carbon balance and growth rates were lower in drier periods. This contrasts with drought responses in primary forests, where changes in carbon dynamics are driven by increased stem mortality. These results highlight an important climate change–vegetation feedback, whereby the increasing dry-season lengths being observed across parts of Amazonia may reduce the effectiveness of secondary forests in sequestering carbon and mitigating climate change. In addition, the current rate of forest regrowth in this region was low compared with previous pan-tropical and Amazonian assessments—our secondary forests reached just 41.1% of the average carbon and 56% of the tree diversity in the nearest primary forests—suggesting that these areas are unlikely to return to their original levels on politically meaningful time scales.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Elias","given":"Fernando"},{"family":"Ferreira","given":"Joice"},{"family":"Lennox","given":"Gareth D."},{"family":"Berenguer","given":"Erika"},{"family":"Ferreira","given":"Socorro"},{"family":"Schwartz","given":"Gustavo"},{"family":"Melo","given":"Lia de Oliveira"},{"family":"Reis Júnior","given":"Denilson N."},{"family":"Nascimento","given":"Rodrigo O."},{"family":"Ferreira","given":"Fabrício Nascimento"},{"family":"Espirito-Santo","given":"Fernando"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Charlotte C."},{"family":"Barlow","given":"Jos"}],"citation-key":"eliasAssessingGrowthClimate2020","container-title":"Ecology","DOI":"10.1002/ecy.2954","ISSN":"1939-9170","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2019 by the Ecological Society of America","page":"e02954","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Assessing the growth and climate sensitivity of secondary forests in highly deforested Amazonian landscapes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ecy.2954","volume":"101"},
  {"id":"eliasComparingContemporaryLifetime2022","abstract":"Secondary forests (SFs) growing on previously cleared land could be a low-cost climate change mitigation strategy due to their potential to sequester CO2. However, given widespread changes in climate and land-use in the Amazon in the past 20 years, it is not clear whether current rates of carbon uptake by SFs reflect estimates based on dividing the carbon stock by the estimated age of the forest. This is important, as differences between methodological approaches could lead to important discrepancies in estimates of carbon accumulation. Furthermore, we know little about how carbon uptake rates of secondary forests vary across some of the most deforested regions of the Amazon, where reforestation actions are most needed. Here, we compare the rates of carbon accumulation estimated over the lifetime of a stand (by stand age) with the contemporary rates estimated by recensus data, based on 28 permanent SFs plots distributed across four regions. Then, we compare how carbon uptakes rates vary across regions and how they compare to previous studies. The average rates of contemporary (1.23 ± 0.57 Mg C ha−1 yr−1) and lifetime (1.14 ± 0.63 Mg C ha−1 yr−1) carbon accumulation were strongly correlated (r = 0.78) and similar between regions. Overall, our carbon accumulation rates were much lower than other estimates of Amazonian SFs, which suggests that regions with the greatest opportunities for large-scale implementation of SFs have some of the slowest rates of carbon accumulation. Contrary to predictions from chronosequence analysis, the lack of difference between lifetime and contemporary rates of carbon accumulation suggests forests are maintaining a consistent rate of growth in the first decades after abandonment. These results—combined with the high rates of ongoing environmental change - highlight the importance of continuing to monitor the rate of carbon accumulation in secondary forests. This is necessary to support the implementation and monitoring of large-scale passive restoration in the highly-deforested Amazon.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Elias","given":"Fernando"},{"family":"Ferreira","given":"Joice"},{"family":"Resende","given":"Angélica F."},{"family":"Berenguer","given":"Erika"},{"family":"França","given":"Filipe"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Charlotte C."},{"family":"Schwartz","given":"Gustavo"},{"family":"Nascimento","given":"Rodrigo O."},{"family":"Guedes","given":"Matheus"},{"family":"Chesini Rossi","given":"Liana"},{"family":"Maria Moraes de Seixas","given":"Marina"},{"family":"Melo da Silva","given":"Carolina"},{"family":"Barlow","given":"Jos"}],"citation-key":"eliasComparingContemporaryLifetime2022","container-title":"Forest Ecology and Management","container-title-short":"Forest Ecology and Management","DOI":"10.1016/j.foreco.2022.120053","ISSN":"0378-1127","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,15]]},"page":"120053","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Comparing contemporary and lifetime rates of carbon accumulation from secondary forests in the eastern Amazon","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112722000470","volume":"508"},

Increases in risk were most pronounced for vitamin A in populations with moderate levels of total nutrient intake. Overall, the effects of pollinator decline varied widely among populations and nutrients.

  {"id":"erica.davidsonNitrogenPhosphorusLimitation2004","abstract":"Understanding secondary successional processes in Amazonian terrestrial ecosystems is becoming increasingly important as continued deforestation expands the area that has become secondary forest, or at least has been through a recent phase of secondary forest growth. Most Amazonian soils are highly weathered and relatively nutrient poor, but the role of nutrients as a factor determining successional processes is unclear. Soils testing and chronosequence studies have yielded equivocal results regarding the possible role of nutrient limitation. The objective of this paper is to report the ﬁrst two years’ results of a nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilization experiment in a 6-yr-old secondary forest growing on an abandoned cattle pasture on a clayey Oxisol. Growth of remnant grasses responded signiﬁcantly to the N ϩ P treatment, whereas tree biomass increased signiﬁcantly following N-only and N ϩ P treatments. The plants took up about 10% of the 50 kg P/ha of the ﬁrst year’s application, and recovery in soil fractions could account for the rest. The trees took up about 20% of the 100 kg N/ha of the ﬁrst year’s application. No changes in soil inorganic N, soil microbial biomass N, or litter decomposition rates have been observed so far, but soil faunal abundances increased in fertilized plots relative to the control in the second year of the study. A pulse of nitric oxide and nitrous oxide emissions was measured in the N-treated plots only shortly after the second year’s application. Net N mineralization and net nitriﬁcation assays demonstrated strong immobilization potential, indicating that much of the N was probably retained in the large soil organic-N pool. Although P availability is low in these soils and may partially limit biomass growth, the most striking result of this study so far is the signiﬁcant response of tree growth to N fertilization. Repeated ﬁre and other losses of N from degraded pastures may render tree growth N limited in some young Amazonian forests. Changes in species composition and monitoring of long-term effects on biomass accumulation will be addressed as this experiment is continued.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"literal":"Eric A.

  {"id":"esquivel-muelbertCompositionalResponseAmazon2019","abstract":"Most of the planet's diversity is concentrated in the tropics, which includes many regions undergoing rapid climate change. Yet, while climate-induced biodiversity changes are widely documented elsewhere, few studies have addressed this issue for lowland tropical ecosystems. Here we investigate whether the floristic and functional composition of intact lowland Amazonian forests have been changing by evaluating records from 106 long-term inventory plots spanning 30 years. We analyse three traits that have been hypothesized to respond to different environmental drivers (increase in moisture stress and atmospheric CO2 concentrations): maximum tree size, biogeographic water-deficit affiliation and wood density. Tree communities have become increasingly dominated by large-statured taxa, but to date there has been no detectable change in mean wood density or water deficit affiliation at the community level, despite most forest plots having experienced an intensification of the dry season. However, among newly recruited trees, dry-affiliated genera have become more abundant, while the mortality of wet-affiliated genera has increased in those plots where the dry season has intensified most. Thus, a slow shift to a more dry-affiliated Amazonia is underway, with changes in compositional dynamics (recruits and mortality) consistent with climate-change drivers, but yet to significantly impact whole-community composition. The Amazon observational record suggests that the increase in atmospheric CO2 is driving a shift within tree communities to large-statured species and that climate changes to date will impact forest composition, but long generation times of tropical trees mean that biodiversity change is lagging behind climate change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Esquivel-Muelbert","given":"Adriane"},{"family":"Baker","given":"Timothy R."},{"family":"Dexter","given":"Kyle G."},{"family":"Lewis","given":"Simon L."},{"family":"Brienen","given":"Roel J.

Deforestation has increased human exposure to mosquito vectors and malaria risk in Africa, but there is little understanding of how socioeconomic and ecological factors moderate this relationship. We examined the relationship between deforestation and malaria prevalence for children under five in six Sub-Saharan African countries, using demographic and health survey data for 11746 children linked to remotely sensed environmental variables. We find that deforestation is associated with increased malaria prevalence. This relationship is strongest in the poorest households but not significant in the richest, suggesting deforestation has disproportionate health impacts on the poor. In poorer households, malaria prevalence is 27–33% larger for one standard deviation increase in deforestation. Deforestation is associated with increased malaria prevalence in regions where\n            Anopheles gambiae\n            and\n            An. funestus\n            are dominant vectors, but not in areas of\n            An. arabiensis\n            . These findings indicate that deforestation is an important driver of malaria risk among the world’s most vulnerable children, and its impact depends critically on often-overlooked social and biological factors.

  {"id":"estrada-villegasLianasReduceBiomass2020","abstract":"Early successional tropical forests could mitigate climate change via rapid accumulation of atmospheric carbon. However, liana (woody vine) abundance and biomass has been increasing in many tropical forests over the past decades, which may slow the speed at which secondary forests accumulate biomass. Lianas decrease biomass accumulation in tropical forests, and may have a particularly strong effect on young forests by stalling tree growth. As forests mature, trees may outgrow or shed lianas, thus escaping some of the negative effects of lianas. Alternatively, lianas may have the strongest effect in older successional forests if the effect of lianas is commensurate with their density, which increases dramatically in the first decades of forest succession. We tested these two hypotheses using a landscape liana-removal experiment in 30 forest stands that ranged from 10 to 35 yr old in Central Panama. We measured tree growth and biomass accumulation in the stands every year from 2014 to 2017. We found that the effect of liana removal on large trees (≥20-cm diameter) decreased with forest age, supporting the hypothesis that lianas have the strongest negative effects on trees, and thus biomass uptake and carbon storage, in very young successional forests. Large trees accumulated more biomass in the absence of lianas in younger forests than in older forests (compared to controls) even after accounting for the effect of canopy completeness and crown illumination, implying that the detrimental effects of lianas go well beyond resource availability and crown health. There was no significant effect of lianas on small trees (1–20-cm diameter), likely because lianas seek light and thus do not deploy their leaves on small trees that are trapped in the forest understory. Our results show that high liana density early in forest succession reduces forest biomass accumulation by negatively impacting large trees, thus decreasing the capacity of young secondary forests to mitigate climate change. Although the negative effects of lianas on forest biomass diminish as forests age, they do not disappear, and thus lianas are an important component of tropical forest carbon budgets throughout succession.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Estrada-Villegas","given":"Sergio"},{"family":"Hall","given":"Jefferson S."},{"family":"Breugel","given":"Michiel","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Schnitzer","given":"Stefan A."}],"citation-key":"estrada-villegasLianasReduceBiomass2020","container-title":"Ecology","DOI":"10.1002/ecy.2989","ISSN":"1939-9170","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2020 by the Ecological Society of America","page":"e02989","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Lianas reduce biomass accumulation in early successional tropical forests","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ecy.2989","volume":"101"},
  {"id":"estrada-villegasLianasSignificantlyReduce2022","abstract":"Lianas are a quintessential tropical plant growth-form; they are speciose and abundant in tropical forests worldwide. Lianas compete intensely with trees, reducing nearly all aspects of tree performance. However, the negative effects of lianas on trees have never been combined and quantified for multiple tropical forests. Here, we present the first comprehensive standardized quantification of the effect of lianas on trees across tropical forests worldwide. We used data from 50 liana removal experiments and quantified the effect size of lianas on tree growth, biomass accretion, reproduction, mortality, leaf water potential, sap flow velocity, and leaf area index (LAI) across different forest types. Using a three-level mixed-effect meta-analysis, we found unequivocal evidence that lianas significantly reduce tree growth and biomass accretion in ecological, logging, and silvicultural studies. Lianas also significantly reduce tree reproduction, recruitment, and physiological performance. The relative detrimental effect of lianas on trees does not increase in drier forests, where lianas tend to be more abundant. Our results highlight the substantial liana-induced reduction in tree performance and biomass accumulation, and they provide quantitative data on the effects of lianas on trees that are essential for large-scale plant demographic and ecosystem models that predict forest change and carbon dynamics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Estrada-Villegas","given":"Sergio"},{"family":"Pedraza Narvaez","given":"Sara Sofia"},{"family":"Sanchez","given":"Adriana"},{"family":"Schnitzer","given":"Stefan A."}],"citation-key":"estrada-villegasLianasSignificantlyReduce2022","container-title":"Frontiers in Forests and Global Change","ISSN":"2624-893X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"source":"Frontiers","title":"Lianas Significantly Reduce Tree Performance and Biomass Accumulation Across Tropical Forests: A Global Meta-Analysis","title-short":"Lianas Significantly Reduce Tree Performance and Biomass Accumulation Across Tropical Forests","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/ffgc.2021.812066","volume":"4"},

Temporal variation has been suggested to occur in these connections, with recent connections for the Northeast and older connections for the Southeast–Northwest. We tested for the hypothesis of temporal variation in these connections using Neotropical mammals as a study group. Phylogenetic and spatial data of sister groups from each forest were combined to access the spatiotemporal patterns of these connections. The relationship between distance route and divergence times was tested using linear regression. The results revealed that the previously suggested spatiotemporal pattern was corroborated only for Rodentia but not for Didelphimorphia and Chiroptera, showing both old and recent connections for all routes. In addition, each family revealed specific connections at different times. We refute the previously proposed absence of old connections through the Northeast route. Rather, temporal variation in the Northeast differs among the mammalian groups according to their evolutionary histories. Owing to the biogeographical history of each group, different connections were found at different times. Therefore, connections between these forests cannot be explained by a single spatiotemporal pattern.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Fabrício Machado","given":"Arielli"},{"family":"Nakamura","given":"Gabriel"},{"family":"Duarte Ritter","given":"Camila"},{"family":"Duarte","given":"Leandro"}],"citation-key":"fabriciomachadoSpatiotemporalPatternsHistorical2023","container-title":"Biological Journal of the Linnean Society","container-title-short":"Biological Journal of the Linnean Society","DOI":"10.1093/biolinnean/blad128","ISSN":"0024-4066","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,1]]},"page":"blad128","source":"Silverchair","title":"Spatiotemporal patterns of historical connections between Amazonian and Atlantic forests","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/biolinnean/blad128"},

It is also very diverse, with different authors measuring fragmentation in different ways and, as a consequence, drawing different conclusions regarding both the magnitude and direction of its effects. Habitat fragmentation is usually defined as a landscape-scale process involving both habitat loss and the breaking apart of habitat. Results of empirical studies of habitat fragmentation are often difficult to interpret because (a) many researchers measure fragmentation at the patch scale, not the landscape scale and (b) most researchers measure fragmentation in ways that do not distinguish between habitat loss and habitat fragmentation per se, i.e., the breaking apart of habitat after controlling for habitat loss. Empirical studies to date suggest that habitat loss has large, consistently negative effects on biodiversity. Habitat fragmentation per se has much weaker effects on biodiversity that are at least as likely to be positive as negative. Therefore, to correctly interpret the influence of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity, the effects of these two components of fragmentation must be measured independently. More studies of the independent effects of habitat loss and fragmentation per se are needed to determine the factors that lead to positive versus negative effects of fragmentation per se. I suggest that the term “fragmentation” should be reserved for the breaking apart of habitat, independent of habitat loss.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Fahrig","given":"Lenore"}],"citation-key":"fahrigEffectsHabitatFragmentation2003","container-title":"Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics","DOI":"10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.34.011802.132419","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003"]]},"page":"487-515","source":"Annual Reviews","title":"Effects of Habitat Fragmentation on Biodiversity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.34.011802.132419","volume":"34"},

However, it remains unknown to what extent biodiversity can be enhanced by altering landscape pattern without reducing agricultural production. We propose a framework for this problem, considering separately compositional heterogeneity (the number and proportions of different cover types) and configurational heterogeneity (the spatial arrangement of cover types). Cover type classification and mapping is based on species requirements, such as feeding and nesting, resulting in measures of ‘functional landscape heterogeneity’. We then identify three important questions: does biodiversity increase with (1) increasing heterogeneity of the more-natural areas, (2) increasing compositional heterogeneity of production cover types and (3) increasing configurational heterogeneity of production cover types? We discuss approaches for addressing these questions. Such studies should have high priority because biodiversity protection globally depends increasingly on maintaining biodiversity in human-dominated landscapes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Fahrig","given":"Lenore"},{"family":"Baudry","given":"Jacques"},{"family":"Brotons","given":"Lluís"},{"family":"Burel","given":"Françoise G."},{"family":"Crist","given":"Thomas O."},{"family":"Fuller","given":"Robert J."},{"family":"Sirami","given":"Clelia"},{"family":"Siriwardena","given":"Gavin M."},{"family":"Martin","given":"Jean-Louis"}],"citation-key":"fahrigFunctionalLandscapeHeterogeneity2011","container-title":"Ecology Letters","DOI":"10.1111/j.1461-0248.2010.01559.x","ISSN":"1461-0248","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS","page":"101-112","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Functional landscape heterogeneity and animal biodiversity in agricultural landscapes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2010.01559.x","volume":"14"},

I tested this by estimating the relative importance of habitat loss and habitat spatial pattern (fragmentation) on population extinction, using a simple, spatially explicit simulation model.

In addition to their diversity, Amazonian trees are a key component of the global carbon cycle, assimilating and storing more carbon than any other ecosystem on Earth. Here we ask, using a unique data set of 530 forest plots, if the functions of storing and producing woody carbon are concentrated in a small number of tree species, whether the most abundant species also dominate carbon cycling, and whether dominant species are characterized by specific functional traits. We find that dominance of forest function is even more concentrated in a few species than is dominance of tree abundance, with only ≈1% of Amazon tree species responsible for 50% of carbon storage and productivity. Although those species that contribute most to biomass and productivity are often abundant, species maximum size is also influential, while the identity and ranking of dominant species varies by function and by region.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Fauset","given":"Sophie"},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Michelle O."},{"family":"Gloor","given":"Manuel"},{"family":"Baker","given":"Timothy R."},{"family":"Monteagudo M.","given":"Abel"},{"family":"Brienen","given":"Roel J.W."},{"family":"Feldpausch","given":"Ted R."},{"family":"Lopez-Gonzalez","given":"Gabriela"},{"family":"Malhi","given":"Yadvinder"},{"family":"Ter Steege","given":"Hans"},{"family":"Pitman","given":"Nigel C.A."},{"family":"Baraloto","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Engel","given":"Julien"},{"family":"Pétronelli","given":"Pascal"},{"family":"Andrade","given":"Ana"},{"family":"Camargo","given":"José Luís C."},{"family":"Laurance","given":"Susan G.W."},{"family":"Laurance","given":"William F."},{"family":"Chave","given":"Jerôme"},{"family":"Allie","given":"Elodie"},{"family":"Vargas","given":"Percy Núñez"},{"family":"Terborgh","given":"John W."},{"family":"Ruokolainen","given":"Kalle"},{"family":"Silveira","given":"Marcos"},{"family":"Aymard C.","given":"Gerardo A."},{"family":"Arroyo","given":"Luzmila"},{"family":"Bonal","given":"Damien"},{"family":"Ramirez-Angulo","given":"Hirma"},{"family":"Araujo-Murakami","given":"Alejandro"},{"family":"Neill","given":"David"},{"family":"Hérault","given":"Bruno"},{"family":"Dourdain","given":"Aurélie"},{"family":"Torres-Lezama","given":"Armando"},{"family":"Marimon","given":"Beatriz S."},{"family":"Salomão","given":"Rafael P."},{"family":"Comiskey","given":"James A."},{"family":"Réjou-Méchain","given":"Maxime"},{"family":"Toledo","given":"Marisol"},{"family":"Licona","given":"Juan Carlos"},{"family":"Alarcón","given":"Alfredo"},{"family":"Prieto","given":"Adriana"},{"family":"Rudas","given":"Agustín"},{"family":"Van Der Meer","given":"Peter J."},{"family":"Killeen","given":"Timothy J."},{"family":"Marimon Junior","given":"Ben-Hur"},{"family":"Poorter","given":"Lourens"},{"family":"Boot","given":"Rene G.A."},{"family":"Stergios","given":"Basil"},{"family":"Torre","given":"Emilio Vilanova"},{"family":"Costa","given":"Flávia R.C."},{"family":"Levis","given":"Carolina"},{"family":"Schietti","given":"Juliana"},{"family":"Souza","given":"Priscila"},{"family":"Groot","given":"Nikée"},{"family":"Arets","given":"Eric"},{"family":"Moscoso","given":"Victor Chama"},{"family":"Castro","given":"Wendeson"},{"family":"Coronado","given":"Euridice N.

We use satellite L‐Band Vegetation Optical Depth (L‐VOD) data that provide an integrated (top‐down) estimate of biomass carbon to track changes over 2011–2019. Because the spatial resolution of L‐VOD is coarse (0.25°), it allows limited attribution of the observed changes. We therefore combined high‐resolution annual maps of forest cover and disturbances with biomass maps to model carbon losses (bottom‐up) from deforestation and degradation, and gains from regrowing secondary forests. We show an increase of deforestation and associated degradation losses since 2012 which greatly outweigh secondary forest gains. Degradation accounted for 40% of gross losses. After an increase in 2011, old‐growth forests show a net loss of above‐ground carbon between 2012 and 2019. The sum of component carbon fluxes in our model is consistent with the total biomass change from L‐VOD of 1.3 Pg C over 2012‐2019. Across nine Amazon countries, we found that while Brazil contains the majority of biomass stocks (64%), its losses from disturbances were disproportionately high (79% of gross losses).

Biomass accrual was tree dominated, constituting ≥94% of the total measured biomass in all forests abandoned ≥4 to 6 yr.

Basal area and LAI were 50%–60%, canopy cover and stem density were nearly 100%, and the rapid tree-dominated biomass accrual was 25%–50% of values reported for primary forest. Biomass accumulation may reach an asymptote earlier than expected because of even-aged, monospecific, untiered stand structure. The very slow leaf area accumulation relative to biomass and to reported values for recovery following slash-and-burn indicates a different canopy development pathway that warrants further investigation of causes (e.g., nutrient limitations, competition) and effects on processes such as evapotranspiration and soil water uptake, which would influence long-term recovery rates and have regional implications.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Feldpausch","given":"Ted R."},{"family":"Riha","given":"Susan J."},{"family":"Fernandes","given":"Erick C.

We examined SF regrowth on abandoned pastures over a 4-year period to determine if measured rates of forest recovery differ from chronosequence predictions. We studied the emergence, development and death of over 1300 stems in 10 SFs representing three age classes (o1–5, 6–10 and 11–14 years old). Mean tree biomass accumulation in both the o1–5 and 6–10 years old (4.4 and 5.7 Mg haÀ1 yrÀ1, respectively) abandoned pastures was lower than predicted and deviated signiﬁcantly (57% and 41%) from rates estimated from the chronosequence. The older SFs, with a mean growth rate of 9.9 Mg haÀ1 yrÀ1 followed the rate predicted by the chronosequence. Understocking was the primary cause of low biomass recovery rates in the youngest forests; although the youngest stands had a diameter at breast height increment three times the oldest stands, the youngest stands lacked sufﬁcient density to cumulatively produce high biomass accumulation rates. Four years of measurement indicated that the youngest stands had developed 59% of the stems measured in the older stands during the same time period. The 6–10-year-old stands were rapidly self-thinning and approached stem density values measured in the same aged stands at the onset of the study. Mortality was high for all stands, with 54% of the original stems remaining after 4 years in intermediate-aged stands. The forests were dominated by the tree Vismia, which represented 55–66% of the biomass in all stands. The Vismia share of the biomass was decreasing over time, with other genera replacing the pioneer. Our measured rates of regrowth indicate that generalized estimates of forest regrowth through chronosequence studies will overestimate forest regrowth for the youngest forests that were under land use for longer time-periods before abandonment. Certiﬁed Emission Reductions under the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto protocol should consider these results when predicting and compensating for carbon sequestered under natural forest management.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Feldpausch","given":"Ted R."},{"family":"Prates-Clark","given":"Cassia Da Conceicao"},{"family":"Fernandes","given":"Erick C.M."},{"family":"Riha","given":"Susan J."}],"citation-key":"feldpauschSecondaryForestGrowth2007","container-title":"Global Change Biology","container-title-short":"Global Change Biol","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-2486.2007.01344.x","ISSN":"1354-1013, 1365-2486","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",5]]},"language":"en","page":"967-979","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Secondary forest growth deviation from chronosequence predictions in central Amazonia","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2007.01344.x","volume":"13"},
  {"id":"fernandesnetoAlternativeFunctionalTrajectories2019","abstract":"The recovery capacity and the successional pathways of tropical forests after anthropogenic disturbance vary considerably and may depend on prior land-use type and intensity. It is still unclear if forests subjected to high intensity impact, such as periodically burned pastures, are capable of restoring their original functional properties. This study analysed the functional trait dynamics of the dominant species in successional trajectories following two land uses, pasture or clear-cut, north of Manaus. Fourteen years of demographic data from the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project were used to determine the dominant species of the two successional trajectories, for which leaf area, leaf dry mass content, specific leaf area and wood density were collected, whereas seed mass was obtained from literature. Community weighted mean of each trait was weighted by basal area determined annually along succession. Prinicpal components analysis was used to analyse the extension and direction of the functional trajectories of plots. Forests regenerating from pastures increased in wood density through successional time, but other traits did not change significantly. Succession after clear-cut exhibited increasing leaf dry mass content and seed mass, and decreasing leaf area over time, but no change in wood density. Functional trajectories of plots after clear-cut were more extensive and directional than those of pasture-derived plots. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate how central Amazonian secondary forests subjected to different land uses show differences in functional trait trajectories, in ways parallel to previously shown changes in biomass, floristic diversity and forest structure. These results indicate that natural recovery of forest functional traits is affected by prior land-use history, with implications for management and restoration. Thus, natural recovery of forests on abandoned pastures is much slower than clear-cuts, even though seed sources from mature forests are very close to these areas, and the former may need intervention to counteract the diverted succession.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Fernandes Neto","given":"Jose G."},{"family":"Costa","given":"Flavia R.

  {"id":"ferrenbergChangesAssemblyProcesses2013","abstract":"Although recent work has shown that both deterministic and stochastic processes are important in structuring microbial communities, the factors that affect the relative contributions of niche and neutral processes are poorly understood. The macrobiological literature indicates that ecological disturbances can influence assembly processes. Thus, we sampled bacterial communities at 4 and 16 weeks following a wildfire and used null deviation analysis to examine the role that time since disturbance has in community assembly. Fire dramatically altered bacterial community structure and diversity as well as soil chemistry for both time-points. Community structure shifted between 4 and 16 weeks for both burned and unburned communities. Community assembly in burned sites 4 weeks after fire was significantly more stochastic than in unburned sites. After 16 weeks, however, burned communities were significantly less stochastic than unburned communities. Thus, we propose a three-phase model featuring shifts in the relative importance of niche and neutral processes as a function of time since disturbance. Because neutral processes are characterized by a decoupling between environmental parameters and community structure, we hypothesize that a better understanding of community assembly may be important in determining where and when detailed studies of community composition are valuable for predicting ecosystem function.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Ferrenberg","given":"Scott"},{"family":"O'Neill","given":"Sean P."},{"family":"Knelman","given":"Joseph E."},{"family":"Todd","given":"Bryan"},{"family":"Duggan","given":"Sam"},{"family":"Bradley","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Robinson","given":"Taylor"},{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Steven K."},{"family":"Townsend","given":"Alan R."},{"family":"Williams","given":"Mark W."},{"family":"Cleveland","given":"Cory C."},{"family":"Melbourne","given":"Brett A."},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Lin"},{"family":"Nemergut","given":"Diana R."}],"citation-key":"ferrenbergChangesAssemblyProcesses2013","container-title":"The ISME Journal","container-title-short":"ISME J","DOI":"10.1038/ismej.2013.11","ISSN":"1751-7370","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",6]]},"language":"en","license":"2013 International Society for Microbial Ecology","number":"6","page":"1102-1111","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www-nature-com.proxy3.library.mcgill.ca","title":"Changes in assembly processes in soil bacterial communities following a wildfire disturbance","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/ismej201311","volume":"7"},

To address this critical gap, we conducted a meta-analysis of published data (> 1300 datapoints) to compare belowground plant, microbial and faunal biomass across seven of the major biomes on Earth. We also assembled data to assess biome-level patterns in belowground microbial community composition. Our analysis suggests that variation in microbial biomass is predictable across biomes, with microbial biomass carbon representing 0.6–1.1% of soil organic carbon (r2 = 0.91) and 1–20% of total plant biomass carbon (r2 = 0.42). Approximately 50% of total animal biomass can be found belowground and soil faunal biomass represents < 4% of microbial biomass across all biomes. The structure of belowground microbial communities is also predictable: bacterial community composition and fungal : bacterial gene ratios can be predicted reasonably well from soil pH and soil C : N ratios respectively. Together these results identify robust patterns in the structure of belowground microbial and faunal communities at broad scales which may be explained by universal mechanisms that regulate belowground biota across biomes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Fierer","given":"Noah"},{"family":"Strickland","given":"Michael S."},{"family":"Liptzin","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Bradford","given":"Mark A."},{"family":"Cleveland","given":"Cory C."}],"citation-key":"fiererGlobalPatternsBelowground2009","container-title":"Ecology Letters","DOI":"10.1111/j.1461-0248.2009.01360.x","ISSN":"1461-0248","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS","page":"1238-1249","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Global patterns in belowground communities","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2009.01360.x","volume":"12"},
  {"id":"figueiredoClimateControlSpecies2018","abstract":"Aim To evaluate the relative importance of climatic versus soil data when predicting species distributions for Amazonian plants and to gain understanding of potential range shifts under climate change. Location Amazon rain forest. Methods We produced species distribution models (SDM) at 5-km spatial resolution for 42 plant species (trees, palms, lianas, monocot herbs and ferns) using species occurrence data from herbarium records and plot-based inventories. We modelled species distribution with Bayesian logistic regression using either climate data only, soil data only or climate and soil data together to estimate their relative predictive powers. For areas defined as unsuitable to species occurrence, we mapped the difference between the suitability predictions obtained with climate-only versus soil-only models to identify regions where climate and soil might restrict species ranges independently or jointly. Results For 40 out of the 42 species, the best models included both climate and soil predictors. The models including only soil predictors performed better than the models including only climate predictors, but we still detected a drought-sensitive response for most of the species. Edaphic conditions were predicted to restrict species occurrence in the centre, the north-west and in the north-east of Amazonia, while the climatic conditions were identified as the restricting factor in the eastern Amazonia, at the border of Roraima and Venezuela and in the Andean foothills. Main conclusions Our results revealed that soil data are a more important predictor than climate of plant species range in Amazonia. The strong control of species ranges by edaphic features might reduce species’ abilities to track suitable climate conditions under a drought-increase scenario. Future challenges are to improve the quality of soil data and couple them with process-based models to better predict species range dynamics under climate change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Figueiredo","given":"Fernando O.

Since most hotspots occur in countries where poverty is widespread, the success of conservation efforts depends upon the recognition that poverty can be a significant constraint on conservation, and at the same time conservation is an important component to the alleviation of long-term poverty. In this paper we present five key socio-economic poverty indicators (access to water, undernourishment, potential population pressure, number living below poverty line and debt service) and integrate them with an ecologically based hotspots analysis in order to illustrate magnitude of the overlap between biological conservation and poverty. The analysis here suggests that the overlap between severe, multifaceted poverty and key areas of global biodiversity is great and needs to be acknowledged. Understanding the magnitude of overlap and interactions among poverty, conservation and macroeconomic processes is crucial for identifying illusive, yet possible, win–win solutions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Fisher","given":"Brendan"},{"family":"Christopher","given":"Treg"}],"citation-key":"fisherPovertyBiodiversityMeasuring2007","container-title":"Ecological Economics","container-title-short":"Ecological Economics","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecolecon.2006.05.020","ISSN":"0921-8009","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",4,1]]},"page":"93-101","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Poverty and biodiversity: Measuring the overlap of human poverty and the biodiversity hotspots","title-short":"Poverty and biodiversity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800906002916","volume":"62"},

We argue that stronger and more innovative connections to data, across the range of scales considered, are required to address these gaps in understanding.

  {"id":"florentineRestorationAbandonedTropical2004","abstract":"Tropical rainforests have been disappearing at an alarming rate. In addition to preserving remaining tropical rainforests, we need to convert degraded and abandoned pasturelands into secondary forests. To accelerate this, human intervention in the recovery process is essential. In this review paper we (i) encapsulate some of the problems, which might surface when converting abandoned land to secondary forest. (ii) Look at some of the restoration techniques used in restoration programs and propose additional techniques for consideration. Major barriers to natural regeneration on abandoned and degraded pasturelands are: weed infestation, lack of indigenous soil seed bank, lack of seed supply/movement, soil compaction, depletion of soil nutrients and unsuitable microclimate and microhabitat. Although several restoration techniques have been recommended, most restoration programs have been carried out using native seedling transplants to accelerate natural recruitment. Most restoration groups in the tropics are still in the initial stages of determining which species or species combination to chose to gain maximum beneﬁt. On the other hand restoration ecologists are struggling to detect which techniques are most appropriate to restore degraded and abandoned pasturelands. Our review shows that there is immediate need for further research and development on restoration techniques by examining the ecological and economic effectiveness of: direct seeding, stem cuttings using native pioneer or climax species and simple manipulation such as displacing branches of pioneer species with mature seeds on abandoned and degraded pasturelands and artiﬁcial perching to accelerate natural regeneration.

  {"id":"floresCriticalTransitionsAmazon2024","abstract":"The possibility that the Amazon forest system could soon reach a tipping point, inducing large-scale collapse, has raised global concern1–3. For 65 million years, Amazonian forests remained relatively resilient to climatic variability. Now, the region is increasingly exposed to unprecedented stress from warming temperatures, extreme droughts, deforestation and fires, even in central and remote parts of the system1. Long existing feedbacks between the forest and environmental conditions are being replaced by novel feedbacks that modify ecosystem resilience, increasing the risk of critical transition. Here we analyse existing evidence for five major drivers of water stress on Amazonian forests, as well as potential critical thresholds of those drivers that, if crossed, could trigger local, regional or even biome-wide forest collapse. By combining spatial information on various disturbances, we estimate that by 2050, 10% to 47% of Amazonian forests will be exposed to compounding disturbances that may trigger unexpected ecosystem transitions and potentially exacerbate regional climate change. Using examples of disturbed forests across the Amazon, we identify the three most plausible ecosystem trajectories, involving different feedbacks and environmental conditions. We discuss how the inherent complexity of the Amazon adds uncertainty about future dynamics, but also reveals opportunities for action. Keeping the Amazon forest resilient in the Anthropocene will depend on a combination of local efforts to end deforestation and degradation and to expand restoration, with global efforts to stop greenhouse gas emissions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Flores","given":"Bernardo M."},{"family":"Montoya","given":"Encarni"},{"family":"Sakschewski","given":"Boris"},{"family":"Nascimento","given":"Nathália"},{"family":"Staal","given":"Arie"},{"family":"Betts","given":"Richard A."},{"family":"Levis","given":"Carolina"},{"family":"Lapola","given":"David M."},{"family":"Esquível-Muelbert","given":"Adriane"},{"family":"Jakovac","given":"Catarina"},{"family":"Nobre","given":"Carlos A."},{"family":"Oliveira","given":"Rafael S."},{"family":"Borma","given":"Laura S."},{"family":"Nian","given":"Da"},{"family":"Boers","given":"Niklas"},{"family":"Hecht","given":"Susanna B."},{"family":"Steege","given":"Hans","non-dropping-particle":"ter"},{"family":"Arieira","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Lucas","given":"Isabella L."},{"family":"Berenguer","given":"Erika"},{"family":"Marengo","given":"José A."},{"family":"Gatti","given":"Luciana V."},{"family":"Mattos","given":"Caio R.

  {"id":"floresFireDisturbanceAmazonian2014","abstract":"Background: Large fire scars were detected in floodplain forests of the middle Rio Negro in dry years of the 1990s, using satellite data. Aim: To relate fire years and river level anomalies to the Tropical Pacific Southern Oscillation Index (SOI); to measure fire damage and post-fire succession rate. Methods: We analysed the relationship between the SOI and water levels for 1968–2010. In Landsat images of the 1990s we determined fire scar ages. Using QuickBird images, we measured forest cover loss in 36 of these scars, covering 873 ha. This was validated by field measurements of tree mortality in 15 scars. As a metric of post-fire succession, we compared change in the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) in 10 large floodplain fire scars and 12 terra firme slash-and-burn fallows. Results: SOI explained 32% of the variation in annual low water level. Forest cover loss in the 36 burn scars was 88% ± 8% (mean ± SD), range 67–98%. Post-fire tree mortality was 91%, ±8%, range 75–100%. Correlation between cover loss and mortality was 73% (P < 0.002). Forest recovery was very slow. EVI values typical of bare soil were still present 13 years after the fires, indicating a successional stage similar to the first year in terra firme sites.

  {"id":"floresFloodplainsAchillesHeel2017","abstract":"Significance\n            Climate change may alter the distribution of biomes in tropical regions with implications for biodiversity and ecosystem services. Here we reveal that if the Amazon region becomes drier as predicted, forests may collapse first on seasonally inundated areas due to their vulnerability to wildfires. The widespread distribution of floodplain forests at the western and central regions implies that fire-prone savannas may expand deep into this massive forest biome, threatening the resilience of the entire system. Our findings suggest the need for a strategic fire management plan to strengthen Amazonian forest resilience in the face of climate change.\n          , \n            The massive forests of central Amazonia are often considered relatively resilient against climatic variation, but this view is challenged by the wildfires invoked by recent droughts. The impact of such fires that spread from pervasive sources of ignition may reveal where forests are less likely to persist in a drier future. Here we combine field observations with remotely sensed information for the whole Amazon to show that the annually inundated lowland forests that run through the heart of the system may be trapped relatively easily into a fire-dominated savanna state. This lower forest resilience on floodplains is suggested by patterns of tree cover distribution across the basin, and supported by our field and remote sensing studies showing that floodplain fires have a stronger and longer-lasting impact on forest structure as well as soil fertility. Although floodplains cover only 14% of the Amazon basin, their fires can have substantial cascading effects because forests and peatlands may release large amounts of carbon, and wildfires can spread to adjacent uplands. Floodplains are thus an Achilles’ heel of the Amazon system when it comes to the risk of large-scale climate-driven transitions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Flores","given":"Bernardo M."},{"family":"Holmgren","given":"Milena"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Chi"},{"family":"Van Nes","given":"Egbert H."},{"family":"Jakovac","given":"Catarina C."},{"family":"Mesquita","given":"Rita C.

  {"id":"flynnFunctionalPhylogeneticDiversity2011","abstract":"How closely does variability in ecologically important traits reflect evolutionary divergence? The use of phylogenetic diversity (PD) to predict biodiversity effects on ecosystem functioning, and more generally the use of phylogenetic information in community ecology, depends in part on the answer to this question. However, comparisons of the predictive power of phylogenetic diversity and functional diversity (FD) have not been conducted across a range of experiments. To address how phylogenetic diversity and functional trait variation control biodiversity effects on biomass production, we summarized the results of 29 grassland plant experiments where both the phylogeny of plant species used in the experiments is well described and where extensive trait data are available. Functional trait variation was only partially related to phylogenetic distances between species, and the resulting FD values therefore correlate only partially with PD. Despite these differences, FD and PD predicted biodiversity effects across all experiments with similar strength, including in subsets that excluded plots with legumes and that focused on fertilization experiments. Two- and three-trait combinations of the five traits used here (leaf nitrogen percentage, height, specific root length, leaf mass per unit area, and nitrogen fixation) resulted in the FD values with the greatest predictive power. Both PD and FD can be valuable predictors of the effect of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning, which suggests that a focus on both community trait diversity and evolutionary history can improve understanding of the consequences of biodiversity loss.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Flynn","given":"Dan F.

  {"id":"forzieriEmergingSignalsDeclining2022","abstract":"Forest ecosystems depend on their capacity to withstand and recover from natural and anthropogenic perturbations (that is, their resilience)1. Experimental evidence of sudden increases in tree mortality is raising concerns about variation in forest resilience2, yet little is known about how it is evolving in response to climate change. Here we integrate satellite-based vegetation indices with machine learning to show how forest resilience, quantified in terms of critical slowing down indicators3–5, has changed during the period 2000–2020. We show that tropical, arid and temperate forests are experiencing a significant decline in resilience, probably related to increased water limitations and climate variability. By contrast, boreal forests show divergent local patterns with an average increasing trend in resilience, probably benefiting from warming and CO2 fertilization, which may outweigh the adverse effects of climate change. These patterns emerge consistently in both managed and intact forests, corroborating the existence of common large-scale climate drivers. Reductions in resilience are statistically linked to abrupt declines in forest primary productivity, occurring in response to slow drifting towards a critical resilience threshold. Approximately 23% of intact undisturbed forests, corresponding to 3.32 Pg C of gross primary productivity, have already reached a critical threshold and are experiencing a further degradation in resilience. Together, these signals reveal a widespread decline in the capacity of forests to withstand perturbation that should be accounted for in the design of land-based mitigation and adaptation plans.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Forzieri","given":"Giovanni"},{"family":"Dakos","given":"Vasilis"},{"family":"McDowell","given":"Nate G."},{"family":"Ramdane","given":"Alkama"},{"family":"Cescatti","given":"Alessandro"}],"citation-key":"forzieriEmergingSignalsDeclining2022","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-022-04959-9","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7923","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",8]]},"language":"en","license":"2022 The Author(s)","number":"7923","page":"534-539","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www-nature-com.proxy3.library.mcgill.ca","title":"Emerging signals of declining forest resilience under climate change","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04959-9","volume":"608"},

This study focuses on Costa Rica, which experienced over 100 000 cases of DF/DHF from 2003 to 2007. We utilized data on sea-surface temperature anomalies related to the El Nin˜o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and two vegetation indices derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) from the Terra satellite to model the inﬂuence of climate and vegetation dynamics on DF/DHF cases in Costa Rica. Cross-correlations were calculated to evaluate both positive and negative lag effects on the relationships between independent variables and DF/DHF cases. The model, which utilizes a sinusoid and non-linear least squares to ﬁt case data, was able to explain 83% of the variance in weekly DF/DHF cases when independent variables were shifted backwards in time. When the independent variables were shifted forward in time, consistently with a forecasting approach, the model explained 64% of the variance. Importantly, when ﬁve ENSO and two vegetation indices were included, the model reproduced a major DF/DHF epidemic of 2005. The unexplained variance in the model may be due to herd immunity and vector control measures, although information regarding these aspects of the disease system are generally lacking. Our analysis suggests that the model may be used to predict DF/DHF outbreaks as early as 40 weeks in advance and may also provide valuable information on the magnitude of future epidemics. In its current form it may be used to inform national vector control programs and policies regarding control measures; it is the ﬁrst climate-based dengue model developed for this country and is potentially scalable to the broader region of Latin America and the Caribbean where dramatic increases in DF/DHF incidence and spread have been observed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Fuller","given":"D O"},{"family":"Troyo","given":"A"},{"family":"Beier","given":"J C"}],"citation-key":"fullerNinoSouthernOscillation2009","container-title":"Environmental Research Letters","container-title-short":"Environ.

  {"id":"galikRisksForestCarbon2009","abstract":"When included as part of a larger greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction program, forest offsets may provide low-cost opportunities for GHG mitigation. One barrier to including forest offsets in climate policy is the risk of reversal, the intentional or unintentional release of carbon back to the atmosphere due to storms, ﬁre, pests, land use decisions, and many other factors. To address this shortcoming, a variety of different strategies have emerged to minimize either the risk or the ﬁnancial and environmental implications of reversal. These strategies range from management decisions made at the individual stand level to buffers and set-asides that function across entire trading programs. For such strategies to work, the actual risk and magnitude of potential reversals need to be clearly understood. In this paper we examine three factors that are likely to inﬂuence reversal risk: natural disturbances (such as storms, ﬁre, and insect outbreaks), climate change, and landowner behavior. Although increases in atmospheric CO2 and to a lesser extent warming will likely bring beneﬁts to some forest ecosystems, temperature stress may result in others. Furthermore, optimism based on experimental results of physiology and growth must be tempered with knowledge that future large-scale disturbances and extreme weather events are also likely to increase. At the individual project level, management strategies such as manipulation of forest structure, age, and composition can be used to inﬂuence carbon sequestration and reversal risk. Because some management strategies have the potential to maximize risk or carbon objectives at the expense of the other, policymakers should ensure that forest offset policies and programs do not provide the singular incentive to maximize carbon storage. Given the scale and magnitude of potential disturbance events in the future, however, management decisions at the individual project level may be insufﬁcient to adequately address reversal risk; other, non-silvicultural strategies and policy mechanisms may be necessary. We conclude with a brief review of policy mechanisms that have been developed or proposed to help manage or mitigate reversal risk at both individual project and policy-wide scales.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Galik","given":"Christopher S."},{"family":"Jackson","given":"Robert B."}],"citation-key":"galikRisksForestCarbon2009","container-title":"Forest Ecology and Management","container-title-short":"Forest Ecology and Management","DOI":"10.1016/j.foreco.2009.03.017","ISSN":"03781127","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",5]]},"language":"en","page":"2209-2216","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Risks to forest carbon offset projects in a changing climate","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378112709001960","volume":"257"},

Important findings are that human activities increasingly dominate the N budget at the global and at most regional scales, the terrestrial and open ocean N budgets are essentially disconnected, and the fixed forms of N are accumulating in most environmental reservoirs.

We provide a critical synthesis of the scientific insights that guide our understanding of patterns and processes underpinning forest biodiversity in the human-modified tropics, and present a conceptual framework that integrates a broad range of social and ecological factors that define and contextualize the possible future of tropical forest species. A growing body of research demonstrates that spatial and temporal patterns of biodiversity are the dynamic product of interacting historical and contemporary human and ecological processes. These processes vary radically in their relative importance within and among regions, and have effects that may take years to become fully manifest. Interpreting biodiversity research findings is frequently made difficult by constrained study designs, low congruence in species responses to disturbance, shifting baselines and an over-dependence on comparative inferences from a small number of well studied localities. Spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the potential prospects for biodiversity conservation can be explained by regional differences in biotic vulnerability and anthropogenic legacies, an ever-tighter coupling of human-ecological systems and the influence of global environmental change. These differences provide both challenges and opportunities for biodiversity conservation. Building upon our synthesis we outline a simple adaptive-landscape planning framework that can help guide a new research agenda to enhance biodiversity conservation prospects in the human-modified tropics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Gardner","given":"Toby A."},{"family":"Barlow","given":"Jos"},{"family":"Chazdon","given":"Robin"},{"family":"Ewers","given":"Robert M."},{"family":"Harvey","given":"Celia A."},{"family":"Peres","given":"Carlos A."},{"family":"Sodhi","given":"Navjot S."}],"citation-key":"gardnerProspectsTropicalForest2009","container-title":"Ecology Letters","DOI":"10.1111/j.1461-0248.2009.01294.x","ISSN":"1461-0248","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS","page":"561-582","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Prospects for tropical forest biodiversity in a human-modified world","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2009.01294.x","volume":"12"},

Most studies of Amazonia’s carbon balance have been limited by sparse sampling. We measured 742 atmospheric vertical profiles of CO2 and CO over four regions of Amazonia from 2010 through 2020. We estimate that Amazon carbon emissions increased from 0.24±0.19 PgC y-1 in 2010-18 to 0.44±0.22 in 2019 and 0.52±0.22 PgC y-1 in 2020. During these years, increases were also observed in deforestation (79% and 74%) and forest burned area (14% and 42%). Field notifications for illegal deforestation and related crimes dropped by 42%, while fines paid for judgments held fell by 89%. Carbon losses during 2019 and 2020 were comparable to losses in the record warm El Nino event of 2015-16, but this time with usual to moderate Oceanic Ninõ Index. 2020 showed 12% decrease in precipitation indicating also a climate impact in carbon emissions. The changes during 2019 and 2020 were mainly due to the western Amazonia becoming also a carbon source. We hypothesize that the consequences of the collapse in enforcement led to increase in deforestation, biomass burning and degradation producing net carbon losses and enhancing drying and warming of forest regions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Gatti","given":"Luciana"},{"family":"Cunha","given":"Camilla"},{"family":"Marani","given":"Luciano"},{"family":"Cassol","given":"Henrique"},{"family":"Messias","given":"Cassiano"},{"family":"Arai","given":"Egidio"},{"family":"Basso","given":"Luana"},{"family":"Soler","given":"Luciana"},{"family":"Almeida","given":"Claudio"},{"family":"Setzer","given":"Alberto"},{"family":"Domingues","given":"Lucas"},{"family":"Denning","given":"Scott"},{"family":"Miller","given":"John"},{"family":"Gloor","given":"Manuel"},{"family":"Correia","given":"Caio"},{"family":"Tejada","given":"Graciela"},{"family":"Neves","given":"Raiane"},{"family":"Rajão","given":"Raoni"},{"family":"Nunes","given":"Felipe"},{"family":"Soares-Filho","given":"Britaldo"},{"family":"Schmitt","given":"Jair"},{"family":"Nobre","given":"Carlos"},{"family":"Correa","given":"Sergio"},{"family":"Sanchez","given":"Alber"},{"family":"Aragão","given":"Luiz"},{"family":"Anderson","given":"Liana"},{"family":"Von Randow","given":"Celso"},{"family":"Crispim","given":"Stephane"},{"family":"Silva","given":"Francine"},{"family":"Machado","given":"Guilherme"}],"citation-key":"gattiAmazonCarbonEmissions2022","DOI":"10.21203/rs.3.rs-2023624/v1","genre":"preprint","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,19]]},"language":"en","publisher":"In Review","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Amazon carbon emissions double mainly by dismantled in law enforcement","type":"report","URL":"https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-2023624/v1"},

  {"id":"gattiChapter6AAmazon2021","abstract":"The main objective of this cross-chapter is to summarize the status of the Amazon as a source or sink of carbon (C). The processes and studies involved are detailed in other SPA chapters. The major challenge of determining the Amazon’s status as a net C source or sink at a continental scale is that many complex processes contribute to C fluxes. Unlike in other regions, emissions from the burning of fossil fuels are minor contributors to Amazonian fluxes. Instead, the major sinks and sources of C to the atmosphere are associated with the net accumulation or loss of biomass, with losses including deforestation, biomass burning, and tree mortality followed by decomposition. Biomass accumulates in areas where tree growth exceeds losses. The Amazon includes not only intact forests, also but degraded and logged forests, natural non-forests, agricultural and urban areas, and aquatic systems including wetlands that all contribute to regional carbon cycling.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Gatti","given":"Luciana V"},{"family":"Melack","given":"John"},{"family":"Basso","given":"Luana S"},{"family":"Restrepo-Coupe","given":"Natalia"},{"family":"Aguiar","given":"Ana Paula"},{"family":"Pangala","given":"Sunitha"},{"family":"Saleska","given":"Scott R"},{"family":"Aragão","given":"Luiz E O"},{"family":"Phillips","given":"Oliver L"},{"family":"Armenteras","given":"Dolors"}],"citation-key":"gattiChapter6AAmazon2021","container-author":[{"literal":"Science Panel for the Amazon"}],"container-title":"Amazon Assessment Report 2021","DOI":"10.55161/VNBV7494","edition":"1","editor":[{"family":"Nobre","given":"Carlos"},{"family":"Encalada","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Anderson","given":"Elizabeth"},{"family":"Roca Alcazar","given":"Fernando Hector"},{"family":"Bustamante","given":"Mercedes"},{"family":"Mena","given":"Carlos"},{"family":"Peña-Claros","given":"Marielos"},{"family":"Poveda","given":"German"},{"family":"Rodriguez","given":"Jon Paul"},{"family":"Saleska","given":"Scott"},{"family":"Trumbore","given":"Susan E"},{"family":"Val","given":"Adalberto"},{"family":"Villa Nova","given":"Luciana"},{"family":"Abramovay","given":"Ricardo"},{"family":"Alencar","given":"Ane"},{"family":"Rodriguez Alzza","given":"Ana Carolina"},{"family":"Armenteras","given":"Dolors"},{"family":"Artaxo","given":"Paulo"},{"family":"Athayde","given":"Simone"},{"family":"Barretto Filho","given":"Henyo Trindade"},{"family":"Barlow","given":"Jos"},{"family":"Berenguer","given":"Erika"},{"family":"Bortolotto","given":"Fernanda"},{"family":"Costa","given":"Francisco De Assis"},{"family":"Costa","given":"Marcos H"},{"family":"Cuvi","given":"Nicolás"},{"family":"Fearnside","given":"Philip"},{"family":"Ferreira","given":"Joice"},{"family":"Flores","given":"Bernardo M"},{"family":"Frieri","given":"Sandra"},{"family":"Gatti","given":"Luciana V"},{"family":"Guayasamin","given":"Juan Manuel"},{"family":"Hecht","given":"Susanna"},{"family":"Hirota","given":"Marina"},{"family":"Hoorn","given":"Carina"},{"family":"Josse","given":"Carmen"},{"family":"Lapola","given":"David M"},{"family":"Larrea","given":"Carlos"},{"family":"Larrea-Alcazar","given":"Daniel M"},{"family":"Lehm Ardaya","given":"Zulema"},{"family":"Malhi","given":"Yadvinder"},{"family":"Marengo","given":"José A"},{"family":"Melack","given":"John"},{"family":"Moraes R.","given":"Mónica"},{"family":"Moutinho","given":"Paulo"},{"family":"Murmis","given":"María R"},{"family":"Neves","given":"Eduardo G"},{"family":"Paez","given":"Belen"},{"family":"Painter","given":"Lilian"},{"family":"Ramos","given":"Adriana"},{"family":"Rosero-Peña","given":"Martha Cecilia"},{"family":"Schmink","given":"Marianne"},{"family":"Sist","given":"Plinio"},{"family":"Ter Steege","given":"Hans"},{"family":"Val","given":"Pedro"},{"family":"Van Der Voort","given":"Hein"},{"family":"Varese","given":"Mariana"},{"family":"Zapata-Ríos","given":"Galo"}],"ISBN":"978-1-73480-800-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,12]]},"language":"en","publisher":"UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN)","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Chapter 6A: The Amazon Carbon Budget","title-short":"Chapter 6A","type":"chapter","URL":"https://www.theamazonwewant.org/amazon-assessment-report-2021/"},
  {"id":"gattiIncreasedAmazonCarbon2023","abstract":"The Amazon forest carbon sink is declining, mainly as a result of land-use and climate change1–4. Here we investigate how changes in law enforcement of environmental protection policies may have affected the Amazonian carbon balance between 2010 and 2018 compared with 2019 and 2020, based on atmospheric CO2 vertical profiles5,6, deforestation7 and fire data8, as well as infraction notices related to illegal deforestation9. We estimate that Amazonia carbon emissions increased from a mean of 0.24 ± 0.08 PgC year−1 in 2010–2018 to 0.44 ± 0.10 PgC year−1 in 2019 and 0.52 ± 0.10 PgC year−1 in 2020 (± uncertainty). The observed increases in deforestation were 82% and 77% (94% accuracy) and burned area were 14% and 42% in 2019 and 2020 compared with the 2010–2018 mean, respectively. We find that the numbers of notifications of infractions against flora decreased by 30% and 54% and fines paid by 74% and 89% in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Carbon losses during 2019–2020 were comparable with those of the record warm El Niño (2015–2016) without an extreme drought event. Statistical tests show that the observed differences between the 2010–2018 mean and 2019–2020 are unlikely to have arisen by chance. The changes in the carbon budget of Amazonia during 2019–2020 were mainly because of western Amazonia becoming a carbon source. Our results indicate that a decline in law enforcement led to increases in deforestation, biomass burning and forest degradation, which increased carbon emissions and enhanced drying and warming of the Amazon forests.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Gatti","given":"Luciana V."},{"family":"Cunha","given":"Camilla L."},{"family":"Marani","given":"Luciano"},{"family":"Cassol","given":"Henrique L.

One long-standing generalization is that tropical montane forests are nitrogen (N)-limited whereas lowland forests tend to be N-rich. However, empirical tests of this hypothesis have yielded equivocal results. Here we evaluate the topographic signature of the ecosystem-level tropical N cycle by examining climatic and geophysical controls of surface soil N content and stable isotopes (δ\n              15\n              N) from elevational gradients distributed across tropical mountains globally. We document steep increases in soil N concentration and declining δ\n              15\n              N with increasing elevation, consistent with decreased microbial N processing and lower gaseous N losses. Temperature explained much of the change in N, with an apparent temperature sensitivity (\n              Q\n              10\n              ) of ~1.9. Although montane forests make up 11% of forested tropical land area, we estimate they account for >17% of the global tropical forest soil N pool. Our findings support the existence of widespread microbial N limitation across tropical montane forest ecosystems and high sensitivity to climate warming.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Gay","given":"Justin D."},{"family":"Currey","given":"Bryce"},{"family":"Brookshire","given":"E.

  {"id":"ghazoulDegradationRecoveryChanging2017","abstract":"Conceptual confusion revolves around how to deﬁne, assess, and overcome land, ecosystem, and landscape degradation. Common elements link degradation and recovery processes, offering ways to advance local, regional, and global initiatives to reduce degradation and promote the recovery of ecosystems and landscapes in forest biomes. Biophysical attributes of degradation and recovery can be measured, but the relevance of selected attributes across scales is subject to values that determine preferred states. Degradation deﬁned in the context of a resilience-based approach is a state where the capacity for regeneration is greatly reduced or lost, recovery is arrested, core interactions and feedbacks are broken, and human intervention is required to initiate a trajectory of recovery. Another approach combines degradation and recovery processes through the concept of recovery debt, the cumulative lost beneﬁts incurred, relative to a target state during phases of degradation and recovery. Degradation and recovery can also be described in terms of societal willingness to invest in improved management or restoration. Interventions can facilitate recovery to new stable or persistent states that provide multiple social and ecological beneﬁts at land, ecosystem, and landscape scales. Multiple trajectories of recovery, as well as historic and ongoing chronic environmental change, might, however, mean that recovery to an original reference state is not possible.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Ghazoul","given":"Jaboury"},{"family":"Chazdon","given":"Robin"}],"citation-key":"ghazoulDegradationRecoveryChanging2017","container-title":"Annual Review of Environment and Resources","container-title-short":"Annu.

However, little is known about the drivers of annual tree‐ring formation under tropical hyper‐humid conditions without clear seasonal dry periods or flooding (ever‐wet conditions). Shelford's law states that the deficit or the excess of environmental resources limits plant growth.

Here, we compared ecological outcomes among (1) 12–15-year-old coffee agroforests established with several native shade trees, (2) 12–15-year-old high-diversity restoration plantations, and (3) reference old-growth forests, within a landscape restoration project in the Pontal do Paranapanema region, in the Atlantic Forest of southeastern Brazil. We compared the aboveground biomass, canopy cover, and abundance, richness, and composition of trees, and the regenerating saplings in the three forest types. In addition, we investigated the landscape drivers of natural regeneration in the restoration plantations and coffee agroforests. Reference forests had a higher abundance of trees and regenerating saplings, but had similar levels of species richness compared to coffee agroforests. High-diversity agroforests and restoration plantations did not differ in tree abundance. However, compared to restoration plantations, agroforests showed higher abundance and species richness of regenerating saplings, a higher proportion of animal-dispersed species, and higher canopy cover. The abundance of regenerating saplings declined with increasing density of coffee plants, thus indicating a potential trade-off between productivity and ecological beneﬁts. High-diversity coffee agroforests provide a cost-effective and ecologically viable alternative to high-diversity native tree plantations for large-scale forest restoration within agricultural landscapes managed by local communities, and should be included as part of the portfolio of reforestation options used to promote the global agenda on forest and landscape restoration.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Giudice Badari","given":"Carolina"},{"family":"Bernardini","given":"Luis Eduardo"},{"family":"De Almeida","given":"Danilo R.

  {"id":"godinhocassolQuadpolAdvancedLand2021","abstract":"Secondary forests (SFs) are one of the major carbons sinks in the Neotropics due to the rapid carbon assimilation in their above-ground biomass (AGB). However, the accurate contribution of SFs to the carbon cycle is a great challenge because of the uncertainty in AGB estimates. In this context, the main objective of this study is to explore full polarimetric Advanced Land Observing Satellite/Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (ALOS/PALSAR-2) data to model SFs AGB in the Central Amazon. We carried out the forest inventory in 2014, measuring 23 field plots. Supplementary land-use classification history was used to create 120 additional independent sample plots by adjusting growth curves using SFs age and previous land-use intensity from field plots and literature database. Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) analysis was performed to select the best model by corrected weighted Akaike Information Criterion (AICw) and validated by the leave-one-out bootstrapping method. The best-fitted model has six parameters and explained 65% of the above-ground biomass variability. The prediction error was of Root Mean Square Error of the Prediction (RMSEP) = 8.8 ± 3.0 tonnes ha−1 (8.8%). The most explanatory variables for modelling secondary forest AGB were those that result from multiple scattering (Shannon Entropy), volumetric scattering (Bhattacharya decomposition), and double-bounce scattering (ratio VV/HH, vertically transmitted and received polarization/horizontally transmitted and received polarization). Including past-use of SF areas in the model with the Landsat time series classification, as the frequency of clear cuts and the number of years of active land-use before abandonment, the MLR has increased by 10%, achieving 71% of the variability explained by the model. The uncertainty report showed that ground truth AGB estimation (inventory, allometry, and plot expansion factors) might represent 50% of the errors in the modelling estimation. In contrast, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) inversion models (SAR error and regression) have achieved 20%. The results showed that additional information on secondary forest land-use history could improve the performance of AGB recovery models, as well as can be used to expand the sampling units on tropical forests.","author":[{"family":"Godinho Cassol","given":"Henrique Luis"},{"family":"De Oliveira E Cruz De Aragão","given":"Luiz Eduardo"},{"family":"Moraes","given":"Elisabete Caria"},{"family":"De Brito Carreiras","given":"João Manuel"},{"family":"Shimabukuro","given":"Yosio Edemir"}],"citation-key":"godinhocassolQuadpolAdvancedLand2021","container-title":"Int.

Here, we show that climate and deforestation combined could cause a decline of up to 58% in Amazon tree species richness, whilst deforestation alone may cause 19–36% and climate change 31–37% by 2050. Quantification is achieved by overlaying species distribution models for current and future climate change scenarios with historical and projected deforestation. Species may lose an average of 65% of their original environmentally suitable area, and a total of 53% may be threatened according to IUCN Red List criteria; however, Amazonian protected area networks reduce these impacts. The worst-case combined scenario—assuming no substantial climate or deforestation policy progress—suggests that by 2050 the Amazonian lowland rainforest may be cut into two blocks: one continuous block with 53% of the original area and another severely fragmented block. This outlook urges rapid progress to zero deforestation, which would help to mitigate climate change and foster biodiversity conservation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Gomes","given":"Vitor H.

Yet the inclusion of forests in international climate agreements has been complex, often considered a secondary mitigation option. In the context of the Paris Climate Agreement, countries submitted their (Intended) Nationally Determined Contributions ((I)NDCs), including climate mitigation targets. Assuming full implementation of (I)NDCs, we show that land use, and forests in particular, emerge as a key component of the Paris Agreement: turning globally from a net anthropogenic source during 1990–2010 (1.3 ± 1.1 GtCO2e yr−1) to a net sink of carbon by 2030 (up to −1.1 ± 0.5 GtCO2e yr−1), and providing a quarter of emission reductions planned by countries.

Ever since May’s provocative paper challenging whether ‘large complex systems [are] stable’ various hypotheses have been proposed to explain when stability should be the rule, not the exception. Spatial dynamics may be stabilizing and thus explain high community diversity, yet existing theory on spatial stabilization is limited, preventing comparisons of the role of dispersal relative to species interactions. Here we incorporate dispersal of organisms and material into stability–complexity theory. We find that stability criteria from classic theory are relaxed in direct proportion to the number of ecologically distinct patches in the meta-ecosystem. Further, we find the stabilizing effect of dispersal is maximal at intermediate intensity. Our results highlight how biodiversity can be vulnerable to factors, such as landscape fragmentation and habitat loss, that isolate local communities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Gravel","given":"Dominique"},{"family":"Massol","given":"François"},{"family":"Leibold","given":"Mathew A."}],"citation-key":"gravelStabilityComplexityModel2016","container-title":"Nature Communications","container-title-short":"Nat Commun","DOI":"10.1038/ncomms12457","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",8,24]]},"language":"en","license":"2016 The Author(s)","number":"1","page":"12457","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Stability and complexity in model meta-ecosystems","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12457","volume":"7"},

Using in situ observations, solar-induced fluorescence, and nonlinear machine learning techniques, we show that, in reality, this is not necessarily the case: In many of the wettest parts of this region, photosynthesis and biomass tend to increase with increased atmospheric dryness, despite the associated reductions in canopy conductance to CO2. These results can be largely explained by changes in canopy properties, specifically, new leaves flushed during the dry season have higher photosynthetic capacity than the leaves they replace, compensating for the negative stomatal response to increased dryness. As atmospheric dryness will increase with climate change, our study highlights the importance of reframing how we represent the response of ecosystem photosynthesis to atmospheric dryness in very wet regions, to accurately quantify the land carbon sink.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Green","given":"J.

We focus on both patterns of species replacement and various processes that occur during succession, and suggest that the sequence of processes may be predictable even if species composition is not. We describe forest recovery with respect to old-growth conditions, which we de®ne as the structure, function, and composition of the original forest before conversion, and we examine this recovery process within the context of type and intensity of past land use. The various phases of the recovery process are described in detail: from factors affecting early colonization, changes in light and soil properties, soil±vegetation feedbacks at initial and later successional stages, biomass accumulation, forest productivity, rates of species accumulation, and species composition. The consensus of these analyses is that the regenerative power of Neotropical forest vegetation is high, if propagule sources are close by and land use intensity before abandonment has not been severe. Nevertheless, the recovery of biophysical properties and vegetation is heavily dependent on the interactions between site-speci®c factors and land use, which makes it extremely dif®cult to predict successional trajectories in anthropogenic settings. We attempt, throughout this review, to integrate the structural and functional characteristics of secondary succession as a way to enhance our ability both to predict and manage successional forest ecosystems due to their increasing importance as timber sources, providers of environmental services, and templates for restoration purposes. # 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

  {"id":"guckerDissolvedNutrientExports2016","abstract":"Aim Neotropical biomes are highly threatened by land-use changes, but the catchment-wide biogeochemical effects are poorly understood. Here, we aim to compare exports of dissolved nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from natural and human-impacted catchments in the Neotropics. Location Neotropics. Methods We measured streamwater nutrient concentrations and exports in 20 south-eastern Brazilian catchments with different land uses (natural Cerrado/semi-deciduous forest, pasture, intensive agriculture and urban areas) and conducted a meta-analysis on nutrient exports from Neotropical catchments, both natural and human-impacted. Results Organic forms dominated dissolved nutrient exports in central/south-east Brazil in both natural and human-dominated catchments. Our meta-analysis suggests that there is wide geographic variability in the natural dominance of organic versus inorganic nutrient exports across the Neotropics, and for N a tendency for inorganic and organic forms to vary inversely across sites. We found strong land-use effects, especially in urban areas. In areas naturally dominated by organic N exports, land use did not overturn that dominance, but rather increased the concentration of both inorganic and organic N. In catchments dominated by inorganic N exports or showing equivalent organic and inorganic exports, land use also caused organic exports to be dominant. Land-use effects on P were unclear, probably owing to a paucity of available data, but our results from south-east Brazil suggested that land use also increases dissolved P exports. Main conclusions We show that dominance of inorganic versus organic nutrient exports is highly variable across natural Neotropical catchments, a pattern contrasting with the general tendency for dominance of organic N in natural temperate catchments. Further, we found a general dominance of organic N in most human-impacted catchments, which is in contrast to strong dominance of inorganic N in most human-impacted temperate catchments. Finally, we find that urbanization exerts the strongest impacts on nutrient exports, thus underscoring wastewater treatment as a critical management priority under future land-use change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Gücker","given":"Björn"},{"family":"Silva","given":"Ricky C.

Essential to meeting this challenge is the incorporation of natural capital and the ecosystem services it provides into decision-making. We explore progress and crucial gaps at this frontier, reflecting upon the 10 y since the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. We focus on three key dimensions of progress and ongoing challenges: raising awareness of the interdependence of ecosystems and human well-being, advancing the fundamental interdisciplinary science of ecosystem services, and implementing this science in decisions to restore natural capital and use it sustainably. Awareness of human dependence on nature is at an all-time high, the science of ecosystem services is rapidly advancing, and talk of natural capital is now common from governments to corporate boardrooms. However, successful implementation is still in early stages. We explore why ecosystem service information has yet to fundamentally change decision-making and suggest a path forward that emphasizes: (i) developing solid evidence linking decisions to impacts on natural capital and ecosystem services, and then to human well-being; (ii) working closely with leaders in government, business, and civil society to develop the knowledge, tools, and practices necessary to integrate natural capital and ecosystem services into everyday decision-making; and (iii) reforming institutions to change policy and practices to better align private short-term goals with societal long-term goals.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Guerry","given":"Anne D."},{"family":"Polasky","given":"Stephen"},{"family":"Lubchenco","given":"Jane"},{"family":"Chaplin-Kramer","given":"Rebecca"},{"family":"Daily","given":"Gretchen C."},{"family":"Griffin","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Ruckelshaus","given":"Mary"},{"family":"Bateman","given":"Ian J."},{"family":"Duraiappah","given":"Anantha"},{"family":"Elmqvist","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Feldman","given":"Marcus W."},{"family":"Folke","given":"Carl"},{"family":"Hoekstra","given":"Jon"},{"family":"Kareiva","given":"Peter M."},{"family":"Keeler","given":"Bonnie L."},{"family":"Li","given":"Shuzhuo"},{"family":"McKenzie","given":"Emily"},{"family":"Ouyang","given":"Zhiyun"},{"family":"Reyers","given":"Belinda"},{"family":"Ricketts","given":"Taylor H."},{"family":"Rockström","given":"Johan"},{"family":"Tallis","given":"Heather"},{"family":"Vira","given":"Bhaskar"}],"citation-key":"guerryNaturalCapitalEcosystem2015","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1503751112","issue":"24","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",6,16]]},"page":"7348-7355","publisher":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","source":"www-pnas-org.proxy3.library.mcgill.ca (Atypon)","title":"Natural capital and ecosystem services informing decisions: From promise to practice","title-short":"Natural capital and ecosystem services informing decisions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1503751112","volume":"112"},

This paper reviews the literature for the influence of land use changes on soil C stocks and reports the results of a meta analysis of these data from 74 publications. The meta analysis indicates that soil C stocks decline after land use changes from pasture to plantation (À10%), native forest to plantation (À13%), native forest to crop (À42%), and pasture to crop (À59%). Soil C stocks increase after land use changes from native forest to pasture ( 8%), crop to pasture ( 19%), crop to plantation ( 18%), and crop to secondary forest ( 53%). Wherever one of the land use changes decreased soil C, the reverse process usually increased soil carbon and vice versa. As the quantity of available data is not large and the methodologies used are diverse, the conclusions drawn must be regarded as working hypotheses from which to design future targeted investigations that broaden the database. Within some land use changes there were, however, sufficient examples to explore the role of other factors contributing to the above conclusions. One outcome of the meta analysis, especially worthy of further investigation in the context of carbon sink strategies for greenhouse gas mitigation, is that broadleaf tree plantations placed onto prior native forest or pastures did not affect soil C stocks whereas pine plantations reduced soil C stocks by 12±15%.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Guo","given":"L.

  {"id":"gutierrezForestLandscapeRestoration2022","abstract":"Forest and landscape restoration (FLR) aims to simultaneously restore ecological functionality to deforested or degraded landscapes and ensure the provision of ecosystem services essential for human well-being. Interest in FLR has followed the ambitious commitments made to restore degraded forest by 2030 under the Bonn Challenge and the New York Declaration on Forests. To clarify and define FLR, the Global Partnership on Forest and Landscape Restoration articulated six principles that underlie this approach, but other sets of principles have also been developed. Our paper examines if and to what extent these principles and their interdependencies are captured in frameworks currently used to monitor FLR. We conducted a literature review to identify FLR monitoring frameworks that linked criteria to principles, but found only five appropriate publications. These frameworks were strictly hierarchical and thus unlikely to capture the interactions and interdependencies among different elements of FLR. Two of the five addressed all six principles. Second, we conducted a series of group exercises with experts to characterize the topology of FLR monitoring frameworks by linking criteria to principles and examining interconnections. We cataloged 18 criteria and 76 indicators, in a non-exhaustive exercise. Cognitive mapping of the interconnections between FLR principles and criteria showed that criteria are typically linked to more than one principle indicating the need to consider networked frameworks. However, no FLR monitoring frameworks currently exist for understanding and operationalizing all six principles, and integrating the interconnected processes underpinning FLR planning, monitoring, and assessment.","author":[{"family":"Gutierrez","given":"Victoria"},{"family":"Hallett","given":"James G."},{"family":"Ota","given":"Liz"},{"family":"Sterling","given":"Eleanor"},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Sarah J."},{"family":"Bodin","given":"Blaise"},{"family":"Chazdon","given":"Robin L."}],"citation-key":"gutierrezForestLandscapeRestoration2022","container-title":"Restor.

Yet, there is increasing recognition that these efforts must now include elements of forest quality for biodiversity and ecosystem services. Such data are not yet available globally. Here we introduce two data products, the Forest Structural Condition Index (SCI) and the Forest Structural Integrity Index (FSII), to meet this need for the humid tropics. The SCI integrates canopy height, tree cover, and time since disturbance to distinguish short, open-canopy, or recently deforested stands from tall, closed-canopy, older stands typical of primary forest. The SCI was validated against estimates of foliage height diversity derived from airborne lidar. The FSII overlays a global index of human pressure on SCI to identify structurally complex forests with low human pressure, likely the most valuable for maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem services. These products represent an important step in maturation from conservation focus on forest extent to forest stands that should be considered “best of the last” in international policy settings.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Hansen","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Barnett","given":"Kevin"},{"family":"Jantz","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Phillips","given":"Linda"},{"family":"Goetz","given":"Scott J."},{"family":"Hansen","given":"Matt"},{"family":"Venter","given":"Oscar"},{"family":"Watson","given":"James E.

Our concept of resource limitation has shifted over the past two decades from an earlier paradigm of single-resource limitation towards concepts of co-limitation by multiple resources, which are predicted by various theories. Herein, we summarise multiple-resource limitation responses in plant communities using a dataset of 641 studies that applied factorial addition of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in freshwater, marine and terrestrial systems. We found that more than half of the studies displayed some type of synergistic response to N and P addition. We found support for strict definitions of co-limitation in 28% of the studies: i.e. community biomass responded to only combined N and P addition, or to both N and P when added separately. Our results highlight the importance of interactions between N and P in regulating primary producer community biomass and point to the need for future studies that address the multiple mechanisms that could lead to different types of co-limitation.","author":[{"family":"Harpole","given":"W.

(2) How long does it take to attain maturity? (3) How important are gaps to species regeneration? and (4) What are the important equilibrium processes in neotropical forest dynamics? The absence of regeneration of dominants has often been used as a distinguishing feature of late secondary forest; however, the abundance of shade-intolerant species in mature forest suggests that local absence of regeneration is an inadequate criterion for distinguishing between late secondary and mature forest. Recent studies estimate forest turnover rates of 75-150 years, indicating tropical forests are much more dynamic than thought previously. The dependence on gaps by almost half of the 320 tree species in a Costa Rican wet forest for successful regeneration illustrates the importance of gaps in tropical forest dynamics. Factors important in determining which species successfully colonize a gap are: time of gap occurrence; proximity and dispersal of seeds; size of gap; substrate conditions; and plant-herbivore interactions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Hartshorn","given":"Gary S."}],"citation-key":"hartshornNeotropicalForestDynamics1980","container-title":"Biotropica","DOI":"10.2307/2388152","ISSN":"0006-3606","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1980"]]},"page":"23-30","publisher":"[Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation, Wiley]","source":"JSTOR","title":"Neotropical Forest Dynamics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2388152","volume":"12"},

However, efforts to mitigate climate change through comprehensive, economy-wide GHG emissions reductions may also negatively affect food security, due to indirect impacts on prices and supplies of key agricultural commodities4–6. Here we conduct a multiple model assessment on the combined effects of climate change and climate mitigation efforts on agricultural commodity prices, dietary energy availability and the population at risk of hunger. A robust finding is that by 2050, stringent climate mitigation policy, if implemented evenly across all sectors and regions, would have a greater negative impact on global hunger and food consumption than the direct impacts of climate change. The negative impacts would be most prevalent in vulnerable, low-income regions such as sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, where food security problems are already acute.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Hasegawa","given":"Tomoko"},{"family":"Fujimori","given":"Shinichiro"},{"family":"Havlík","given":"Petr"},{"family":"Valin","given":"Hugo"},{"family":"Bodirsky","given":"Benjamin Leon"},{"family":"Doelman","given":"Jonathan C."},{"family":"Fellmann","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Kyle","given":"Page"},{"family":"Koopman","given":"Jason F.

  {"id":"hauserGlobalScaleShifts2022","abstract":"Rooting depth is an ecosystem trait that determines the extent of soil development and carbon (C) and water cycling. Recent hypotheses propose that human-induced changes to Earth's biogeochemical cycles propagate deeply into Earth's subsurface due to rooting depth changes from agricultural and climate-induced land cover changes. Yet, the lack of a global-scale quantification of rooting depth responses to human activity limits knowledge of hydrosphere-atmosphere-lithosphere feedbacks in the Anthropocene. Here we use  land cover data sets to demonstrate that root depth distributions are changing globally as a consequence of agricultural expansion truncating depths above which 99% of root biomass occurs (D99) by ∼60 cm, and woody encroachment linked to anthropogenic climate change extending D99 in other regions by ∼38 cm. The net result of these two opposing drivers is a global reduction of D99 by 5%, or ∼8 cm, representing a loss of ∼11,600 km 3 of rooted volume. Projected land cover scenarios in 2100 suggest additional future D99 shallowing of up to 30 cm, generating further losses of rooted volume of ∼43,500 km 3, values exceeding root losses experienced to date and suggesting that the pace of root shallowing will quicken in the coming century. Losses of Earth's deepest roots—soil-forming agents—suggest unanticipated changes in fluxes of water, solutes, and C. Two important messages emerge from our analyses: dynamic, human-modified root distributions should be incorporated into earth systems models, and a significant gap in deep root research inhibits accurate projections of future root distributions and their biogeochemical consequences.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Hauser","given":"Emma"},{"family":"Sullivan","given":"Pamela L."},{"family":"Flores","given":"Alejandro N."},{"family":"Hirmas","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Billings","given":"Sharon A."}],"citation-key":"hauserGlobalScaleShifts2022","container-title":"Earth's Future","container-title-short":"Earth's Future","DOI":"10.1029/2022EF002897","ISSN":"2328-4277, 2328-4277","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",11]]},"language":"en","page":"e2022EF002897","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Global‐Scale Shifts in Rooting Depths Due To Anthropocene Land Cover Changes Pose Unexamined Consequences for Critical Zone Functioning","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022EF002897","volume":"10"},
  {"id":"hawbakerLandsatBurnedArea2020","abstract":"Complete and accurate burned area map data are needed to document spatial and temporal patterns of fires, to quantify their drivers, and to assess the impacts on human and natural systems. In this study, we developed the Landsat Burned Area (BA) algorithm, an update from the Landsat Burned Area Essential Climate Variable (BAECV) algorithm. Here, we present the BA algorithm and products, changes relative to the BAECV algorithm and products, and updated validation metrics. We also present spatial and temporal patterns of burned area across the conterminous U.S., how burned area varies in relation to the number of operational Landsat sensors, and a comparison with other burned area datasets, including the BAECV, Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS), GeoMAC, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MCD64A1.006 data. The BA algorithm identifies burned areas in analysis ready data (ARD) time-series of Landsat imagery from 1984 through 2018 using machine learning, thresholding, and image segmentation. Validation with reference data from high-resolution commercial satellite imagery resulted in omission and commission error rates averaging 19% and 41%, respectively. In comparison, validation with Landsat reference data had omission and commission error rates averaging 40% and 28%, respectively when burned areas in cultivated crops and pasture/hay landcover types were excluded. Both validation tests documented lower commission error rates relative to the BAECV products. The amount of burned area detected varies not only in response to climate but also with the number of operational sensors and scenes collected. The combined amount of burned area detected by multiple sensors was larger than from any individual sensor, but there was no significant difference between individual sensors. Therefore, we used BA products from individual sensors to assess trends over time and all available sensors to compare with other existing BA products. From 1984 through 2018, annual burned area averaged 30,000 km2, ranged between 14,000 km2 in 1991 and 46,500 km2 in 2012, and increased over time at a rate of 356 km2/year. Compared to existing burned area products, the new Landsat BA products identified 29% more burned area than the BAECV products (1984–2015), 183% more than the MTBS/GeoMAC products (1984–2018), and 56% more than the MCD64A1.006 products (2003–2018). The products had similar patterns of year-to-year variability; the R2 values of linear regressions between annual burned area were > 0.70 with the BAECV products and the MTBS/GeoMAC products, but somewhat lower for the MCD64A1.006 product (R2 = 0.66). The BA products are routinely produced as new Landsat data are collected and provide a unique data source to monitor and assess the spatial and temporal patterns and the impacts of fire.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Hawbaker","given":"Todd J."},{"family":"Vanderhoof","given":"Melanie K."},{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Gail L."},{"family":"Beal","given":"Yen-Ju"},{"family":"Picotte","given":"Joshua J."},{"family":"Takacs","given":"Joshua D."},{"family":"Falgout","given":"Jeff T."},{"family":"Dwyer","given":"John L."}],"citation-key":"hawbakerLandsatBurnedArea2020","container-title":"Remote Sensing of Environment","container-title-short":"Remote Sensing of Environment","DOI":"10.1016/j.rse.2020.111801","ISSN":"00344257","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",7]]},"language":"en","page":"111801","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Landsat Burned Area algorithm and products for the conterminous United States","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0034425720301711","volume":"244"},
  {"id":"hayesPredictingLossForests2023","abstract":"The loss of tropical forests represents a major threat to biodiversity. With accelerating deforestation in large parts of the Amazon, the Guiana Shield region, with its large expanse of closed forest cover, has the potential to play a crucial role in both climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation. However, the region is now facing increasing deforestation pressures, primarily from artisanal gold mining activities concentrated in the nation of Guyana. To identify areas of Guyana at the highest risk of deforestation over the next 25 years, we employed a spatio-temporal modelling approach that accounted for the stochastic and contagious nature of deforestation. Our model predicted a 9 % net decrease in total forest cover by 2043. While the primary drivers of deforestation were mining and human settlements, protected areas were shown to reduce the probability of deforestation. Therefore, we assessed the potential impact of a proposed expansion of the protected area network in Guyana, on forest loss, carbon stocks and habitat loss for the country's most threatened forest vertebrates. Establishing the proposed protected areas would reduce forest loss by 17 %, predicted habitat losses by an average of 1.9 % per vertebrate group, and aboveground carbon emissions by 466,968 t over the next 25 years. These findings highlight the utility of using predictive models to identify areas at risk of future deforestation, which can contribute to the development of effective strategies against tropical forest loss, biodiversity loss and climate change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Hayes","given":"William Michael"},{"family":"Voigt","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Rosa","given":"Isabel"},{"family":"Cort","given":"Kerry Anne"},{"family":"Kotlinski","given":"Nic"},{"family":"Kalamandeen","given":"Michelle"},{"family":"Davies","given":"Zoe Georgina"},{"family":"Bicknell","given":"Jake Emmerson"}],"citation-key":"hayesPredictingLossForests2023","container-title":"Biological Conservation","container-title-short":"Biological Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/j.biocon.2023.110312","ISSN":"0006-3207","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,1]]},"page":"110312","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Predicting the loss of forests, carbon stocks and biodiversity driven by a neotropical ‘gold rush’","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320723004135","volume":"286"},
  {"id":"healyPartitioningEffectsBiodiversity2008","abstract":"1 Over 5000 trees were grown in plots of differing diversity levels (1, 3 and 6 species) in a plantation established in Panama. Four and five years after establishment, we analysed parameters related to the productivity of this tropical plantation (tree survival, height and biomass as well as plot basal area) to test for the presence of biodiversity effects. The relative importance of environmental heterogeneity (such as soil, topography, and drainage) and biodiversity on tree growth and mortality was determined using partial redundancy analysis. 2 Hierarchical clustering revealed nine different soil clusters based on soil quality and drainage. By chance, the six-species plots were apparently established on more variable soils then on the other diversity levels. We found little evidence for spatial autocorrelation between subplots, with the exception of four subplots located on a ridge that extends on the North–South axis of the plantation and corresponds to a zone of higher productivity. 3 The redundancy analysis indicated that environmental heterogeneity and biodiversity together explained around 50% of the variation in subplot productivity and tree mortality. Environment explained 35–57% of the variation in productivity and mortality, respectively, whereas diversity explained an additional 23–30%. 4 Our simulation model revealed a significant positive effect of biodiversity on growth but no effect of biodiversity on mortality. The standardized effect sizes that we used to detect over- or under-yielding or no effect in comparison with monoculture were highly variable and the variability was largely explained by traits related to site topography. 5 Synthesis. In our tropical tree plantation, we detected biodiversity effects at a scale relevant to conservation and quantified the relative importance of environmental heterogeneity and diversity on tree growth and mortality. Our results support the idea that environmental factors could act as hidden sources of variability in biodiversity experiments. Environmental and spatial heterogeneity induced variable responses to biodiversity and amplified the differences between three- and six-species plots. Species identity explained more variation in productivity than did the species diversity.

However, this apparent up-regulation of the ecosystem N cycle introduces a biogeochemical paradox when considered from the perspective of physiology and evolution of individual plants: The putative source for tropical N richness—symbiotic N fixation—should, in theory, be physiologically down-regulated as internal pools of bioavailable N build. We review the evidence for tropical N richness and evaluate several hypotheses that may explain its emergence and maintenance. We propose a leaky nitrostat model that is capable of resolving the paradox at scales of both ecosystems and individual N-fixing organisms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Hedin","given":"Lars O."},{"family":"Brookshire","given":"E.N.

  {"id":"helmerBiomassAccumulationRates2009","abstract":"We estimate the age of humid lowland tropical forests in Rondônia, Brazil, from a somewhat densely spaced time series of Landsat images (1975-2003) with an automated procedure, the Threshold Age Mapping Algorithm (TAMA), first described here. We then estimate a landscape-level rate of aboveground woody biomass accumulation of secondary forest by combining forest age mapping with biomass estimates from the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS). Though highly variable, the estimated average biomass accumulation rate of 8.4 Mg ha-1 yr-1 agrees well with ground-based studies for young secondary forests in the region. In isolating the lowland forests, we map land cover and general types of old-growth forests with decision tree classification of Landsat imagery and elevation data. We then estimate aboveground live biomass for seven classes of old-growth forest. TAMA is simple, fast, and self-calibrating. By not using between-date band or index differences or trends, it requires neither image normalization nor atmospheric correction. In addition, it uses an approach to map forest cover for the self-calibrations that is novel to forest mapping with satellite imagery; it maps humid secondary forest that is difficult to distinguish from old-growth forest in single-date imagery; it does not assume that forest age equals time since disturbance; and it incorporates Landsat Multispectral Scanner imagery. Variations on the work that we present here can be applied to other forested landscapes. Applications that use image time series will be helped by the free distribution of coregistered Landsat imagery, which began in December 2008, and of the Ice Cloud and land Elevation Satellite Vegetation Product, which simplifies the use of GLAS data. Finally, we demonstrate here for the first time how the optical imagery of fine spatial resolution that is viewable on Google Earth provides a new source of reference data for remote sensing applications related to land cover.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Helmer","given":"Eileen H."},{"family":"Lefsky","given":"Michael A."},{"family":"Roberts","given":"Dar A."}],"citation-key":"helmerBiomassAccumulationRates2009","container-title":"JARS","DOI":"10.1117/1.3082116","ISSN":"1931-3195","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",1]]},"page":"033505","title":"Biomass accumulation rates of Amazonian secondary forest and biomass of old-growth forests from Landsat time series and the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-applied-remote-sensing/volume-3/issue-1/033505/Biomass-accumulation-rates-of-Amazonian-secondary-forest-and-biomass-of/10.1117/1.3082116.short","volume":"3"},

  {"id":"herbertModelAnalysisLimitation2003","abstract":"Productivity and carbon (C) storage in many mature tropical forests are considered phosphorus (P) limited because of advanced soil weathering. However, disturbance can shift limitation away from P and toward nitrogen (N) because of disproportionately large N losses associated with its mobility relative to P in ecosystems. This shift was illustrated by model analyses in which large disturbances including timber extraction and slash-burn were simulated in a P-limited tropical forest. Re-accumulation of ecosystem C during secondary forest growth was initially N-limited, but long term limitation reverted to P. Mechanisms controlling shifts between N and P limitation included: (1) N volatility during slash combustion produced ash that increased soil solution P more than N, (2) a wide N:P ratio in residual fuel and belowground necromass relative to soil organic matter (SOM) N:P produced a simultaneous P sink and N source during decomposition, (3) a supplemental (to aerosol deposition) external N source via biological N fixation. Redistribution of N and P from low C:nutrient SOM to high C:nutrient vegetation was the most important factor contributing to the resilience of ecosystem C accumulation during secondary growth. Resilience was diminished when multiple harvest and re-growth cycles depleted SOM. Phosphorus losses in particular resulted in long-term reductions of C storage capacity because of slow re-supply rates via deposition and the absence of other external sources. Sensitivity analyses limiting the depth of microbially active SOM in soil profiles further illustrated the importance of elements stored in SOM to ecosystem resilience, pointing to a need for better knowledge on the functioning of deeply buried SOM.","author":[{"family":"Herbert","given":"Darrell A."},{"family":"Williams","given":"Mathew"},{"family":"Rastetter","given":"Edward B."}],"citation-key":"herbertModelAnalysisLimitation2003","container-title":"Biogeochemistry","DOI":"10.1023/A:1026020210887","ISSN":"0168-2563","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003"]]},"page":"121-150","title":"A model analysis of N and P limitation on carbon accumulation in Amazonian secondary forest after alternate land-use abandonment","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1026020210887","volume":"65"},

Forests and wetlands can provide ecosystem services that help maintain water quality. To understand the connections between land cover and childhood DD, we compiled a database of 293,362 children in 35 countries with information on health, socioeconomic factors, climate, and watershed condition. Using hierarchical models, here we find that higher upstream tree cover is associated with lower probability of DD downstream. This effect is significant for rural households but not for urban households, suggesting differing dependence on watershed conditions. In rural areas, the effect of a 30% increase in upstream tree cover is similar to the effect of improved sanitation, but smaller than the effect of improved water source, wealth or education.

Our goal in building the model was to construct a relatively simple ecosystem model that would respond to soil and climatic heterogeneity that allows us to study the impact of Amazonian deforestation, selective logging and accidental ﬁre on the global carbon cycle. This paper focuses on the net ﬂux caused by deforestation and forest re-growth over the period from 1970 to 1998. We calculate that the net ﬂux to the atmosphere during this period reached a maximum of $ 0.35 PgC yrÀ1 (1 PgC 5 1 Â 1015 gC) in 1990, with a cumulative release of $7 PgC from 1970 to 1998. The net ﬂux is higher than predicted by an earlier study (Houghton et al., 2000) by a total of 1 PgC over the period 1989–1998 mainly because CARLUC predicts relatively high mature forest carbon storage compared with the datasets used in the earlier study. Incorporating the dynamics of litter and soil carbon pools into the model increases the cumulative net ﬂux by $1 PgC from 1970 to 1998, while different assumptions about land-cover dynamics only caused small changes. The uncertainty of the net ﬂux, calculated with a Monte-Carlo approach, is roughly 35% of the mean value (1 SD).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Hirsch","given":"Adam I."},{"family":"Little","given":"William S."},{"family":"Houghton","given":"Richard A."},{"family":"Scott","given":"Neal A."},{"family":"White","given":"Joseph D."}],"citation-key":"hirschNetCarbonFlux2004","container-title":"Global Change Biology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1529-8817.2003.00765.x","ISSN":"13541013","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004",5]]},"language":"en","page":"908-924","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The net carbon flux due to deforestation and forest re-growth in the Brazilian Amazon: analysis using a process-based model","title-short":"The net carbon flux due to deforestation and forest re-growth in the Brazilian Amazon","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1529-8817.2003.00765.x","volume":"10"},

Carbon dynamics are controlled by multiple eco-physiological processes responding to environmental change, but we lack solid experimental evidence, hampering theory development and thus representation in ecosystem models. Here, we present two ecosystem-scale manipulation experiments, to be carried out in the Amazon, that examine tropical ecosystem responses to eCO2 and alterations in nutrient availability and thus will elucidate the representation of crucial ecological processes by ecosystem models. We highlight current gaps in our understanding of tropical ecosystem responses to projected global changes in light of the eco-physiological assumptions considered by current ecosystem models. We conclude that a more detailed process-based representation of the spatial (e.g., soil type; plant functional type) and temporal (seasonal and inter-annual) variability of tropical forests is needed to enhance model predictions of ecosystem responses to projected global environmental change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Hofhansl","given":"Florian"},{"family":"Andersen","given":"Kelly M."},{"family":"Fleischer","given":"Katrin"},{"family":"Fuchslueger","given":"Lucia"},{"family":"Rammig","given":"Anja"},{"family":"Schaap","given":"Karst J."},{"family":"Valverde-Barrantes","given":"Oscar J."},{"family":"Lapola","given":"David M."}],"citation-key":"hofhanslAmazonForestEcosystem2016","container-title":"Frontiers in Earth Science","ISSN":"2296-6463","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"source":"Frontiers","title":"Amazon Forest Ecosystem Responses to Elevated Atmospheric CO2 and Alterations in Nutrient Availability: Filling the Gaps with Model-Experiment Integration","title-short":"Amazon Forest Ecosystem Responses to Elevated Atmospheric CO2 and Alterations in Nutrient Availability","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2016.00019","volume":"4"},

We use a random coefficients model to test for differences in forest cover across tenure forms over time. Tenure categories are significantly associated with changes in deforestation, even after controlling for multiple factors. Deforestation slows dramatically in the latter time period; and model results link parks with reduced deforestation. The same is true for lands where indigenous territories overlap with forest protection. Our results suggest that Ecuador’s conservation incentive program could refine its targeting by focusing on indigenous areas and communal lands outside of parks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Holland","given":"Margaret B."},{"family":"Koning","given":"Free","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Morales","given":"Manuel"},{"family":"Naughton-Treves","given":"Lisa"},{"family":"Robinson","given":"Brian E."},{"family":"Suárez","given":"Luis"}],"citation-key":"hollandComplexTenureDeforestation2014","collection-title":"Land Tenure and Forest Carbon Management","container-title":"World Development","container-title-short":"World Development","DOI":"10.1016/j.worlddev.2013.01.012","ISSN":"0305-750X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",3,1]]},"page":"21-36","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Complex Tenure and Deforestation: Implications for Conservation Incentives in the Ecuadorian Amazon","title-short":"Complex Tenure and Deforestation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X13000181","volume":"55"},
  {"id":"hollFactorsExplainingVariability2014","abstract":"Secondary forests comprise an increasing area of the tropics and play an important role in global carbon cycling. We compare above-ground biomass accumulation of both planted and naturally regenerating trees, as well as C in the top soil layer, in three restoration treatments replicated at 14, six to eight year old restoration sites in southern Costa Rica. Restoration strategies include: control (no planting), planting tree islands, and conventional, mixed-species tree plantations. We evaluate the importance of past land-use, soil nutrients, understory cover, and surrounding forest cover in explaining variation in above-ground biomass accumulation (ABA) rate across sites. Total ABA and planted tree ABA rate were highest in plantations, intermediate in islands, and lowest in control treatments, whereas ABA rate of naturally regenerating trees did not differ across treatments. Most ABA in plantations (89%) and islands (70%) was due to growth of planted trees. Soil carbon did not change significantly over the time period of the study in any treatment. The majority of across-site variation in both total and planted tree ABA rate was explained by duration of prior pasture use. Tree growth in the first two years after planting explained approximately two-thirds of the variation in ABA rate after 6–8years. Soil nutrient concentrations explained relatively little of the variation in planted or naturally recruiting ABA rate. Our results show that planting trees substantially increases biomass accumulation during the first several years of forest recovery in former agricultural lands and that past-land use has a strong effect on the rate of biomass accumulation. Planting tree islands is a cost-effective strategy for increasing ABA and creating more heterogeneous habitat conditions than tree plantations. We recommend small scale planting trials to quickly assess potential biomass accumulation and prioritize sites for ecosystem service payments for carbon sequestration.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Holl","given":"Karen D."},{"family":"Zahawi","given":"Rakan A."}],"citation-key":"hollFactorsExplainingVariability2014","container-title":"Forest Ecology and Management","container-title-short":"Forest Ecology and Management","DOI":"10.1016/j.foreco.2014.01.024","ISSN":"0378-1127","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",5,1]]},"page":"36-43","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Factors explaining variability in woody above-ground biomass accumulation in restored tropical forest","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112714000267","volume":"319"},
  {"id":"hollFactorsLimitingTropical1999","abstract":"Vegetation, seed rain, seed germination, microclimate, and soil physical and chemical parameters were measured in a recently abandoned pasture and adjacent primary rain forest in southern Costa Rica. The goal of this study was to assess the importance of these factors in limiting forest regeneration in abandoned pastures. Seed rain of animal dispersed species decreased dramatically in the pasture >5 m from the foredpasture edge; fewer wind dispersed seeds fell in the pasture than in the forest, but the difference was much less than for animal dispersed seeds. Percent seed germination of most species studied was similar in the forest and in pasture with grasses; seed germination was lower during the dry season in areas of pasture cleared of grasses. Air temperature, vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and photon flux density (PFD) were much higher in the pasture than in the forest at 1 m above the ground. VPD and PFD at ground level and soil temperature were similar in the pasture and the forest, indicating that pasture grasses strongly modify microclimatic conditions near the soil surface. The lowest gravimetric water content recorded in the pasture during the dry season was 0.5 and leaf relative water contents of the two species measured in the forest and pasture were identical, suggesting that plants in the pasture were not water stressed. Levels of most soil nutrients were lower in the pasture as compared to the forest; however, aboveground and root biomass for seedlings grown in pasture and forest soils did not differ significantly. Although a number of factors impede forest recovery in abandoned pastures, these results suggest that the most important limitation is lack of seed dispersal.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Holl","given":"Karen D."}],"citation-key":"hollFactorsLimitingTropical1999","container-title":"Biotropica","container-title-short":"Biotropica","DOI":"10.1111/j.1744-7429.1999.tb00135.x","ISSN":"0006-3606, 1744-7429","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999",6]]},"language":"en","page":"229-242","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Factors Limiting Tropical Rain Forest Regeneration in Abandoned Pasture: Seed Rain, Seed Germination, Microclimate, and Soil1","title-short":"Factors Limiting Tropical Rain Forest Regeneration in Abandoned Pasture","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1744-7429.1999.tb00135.x","volume":"31"},

Many examples in the tropics and elsewhere, however, show that some ecosystems recover rapidly without human intervention which begs the question of in which cases and to what extent humans should actively work to facilitate ecosystem recovery. We recommend that all land managers consider a suite of ecological and human factors before selecting a restoration approach. Land managers should first consider what the likely outcome of a passive restoration (natural regeneration) approach would be based on the natural ecosystem resilience, past land-use history, and the surrounding landscape matrix. They should also identify the specific goals of the project and assess the resources available. Conducting these analyses prior to selecting restoration approaches should result in a more efficient use of restoration resources both within and among projects and should maximize the success of restoration efforts.","author":[{"family":"Holl","given":"K.

  {"id":"hopkinsModellingKnownUnknown2007","abstract":"Aims The overall aim of this study is to provide the data needed for Amazonian conservation and the sustainable management of the region. To this end I model the hypothetical distribution of plant species richness across the Amazon Basin, the distribution of the proportion of this species richness that can be accounted for by described species, and hence the distribution of the biodiversity which remains unknown. Location Amazonia, Neotropics. Methods Species richness across the Amazon Basin is estimated by comparing the occurrences of 1584 species of Magnoliophyta whose taxonomy and geographical distributions are relatively well known. These data are used to collate checklists for squares of 1° latitude by 1° longitude. Comparison of the checklists allows estimation of the relative expected diversity in the vicinity of each degree square. Summing the distributions of the hypothetical real ranges gives the proportion of the biodiversity that can be accounted for by described species. Subtraction of the second distribution from the first gives a distribution of the contribution to the overall biodiversity that the model predicts, potentially, results from as yet undescribed species. Results Collections documented in recent botanical monographs show an extremely biased distribution with the best knowledge being found in a very few relatively well-collected areas. At the degree square level, this model predicts that gamma biodiversity in the Amazon Basin is uniformly high across most of the basin. The model predicts that four large areas of the basin are particularly poorly known, and that they should contain large numbers of uncollected species. Main conclusions The model presented here highlights the difficulties of quantifying Amazonian plant diversity and its distribution. The low density of collections, and especially their extremely clumped distribution, undermines confidence in theories that seek to explain the apparent distribution of biodiversity. The model's prediction is substantially different from published predictions of the distribution of alpha diversity. Testing of this model in the areas identified as lacunae would require collecting programmes designed to collect fertile material of rare species. If the model's predictions are approximately accurate, the plant biodiversity of the Amazon Basin is considerably underestimated.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Hopkins","given":"Michael J.

  {"id":"hordijkEvennessMediatesGlobal2023","abstract":"Abstract\n            1. Biodiversity is an important component of natural ecosystems, with higher species richness often correlating with an increase in ecosystem productivity. Yet, this relationship varies substantially across environments, typically becoming less pronounced at high levels of species richness. However, species richness alone cannot reflect all important properties of a community, including community evenness, which may mediate the relationship between biodiversity and productivity. If the evenness of a community correlates negatively with richness across forests globally, then a greater number of species may not always increase overall diversity and productivity of the system. Theoretical work and local empirical studies have shown that the effect of evenness on ecosystem functioning may be especially strong at high richness levels, yet the consistency of this remains untested at a global scale.\n            2. Here, we used a dataset of forests from across the globe, which includes composition, biomass accumulation and net primary productivity, to explore whether productivity correlates with community evenness and richness in a way that evenness appears to buffer the effect of richness. Specifically, we evaluated whether low levels of evenness in speciose communities correlate with the attenuation of the richness–productivity relationship.\n            3. We found that tree species richness and evenness are negatively correlated across forests globally, with highly speciose forests typically comprising a few dominant and many rare species. Furthermore, we found that the correlation between diversity and productivity changes with evenness: at low richness, uneven communities are more productive, while at high richness, even communities are more productive.\n            \n              4.\n              Synthesis\n              . Collectively, these results demonstrate that evenness is an integral component of the relationship between biodiversity and productivity, and that the attenuating effect of richness on forest productivity might be partly explained by low evenness in speciose communities. Productivity generally increases with species richness, until reduced evenness limits the overall increases in community diversity. Our research suggests that evenness is a fundamental component of biodiversity–ecosystem function relationships, and is of critical importance for guiding conservation and sustainable ecosystem management decisions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Hordijk","given":"Iris"},{"family":"Maynard","given":"Daniel S."},{"family":"Hart","given":"Simon P."},{"family":"Lidong","given":"Mo"},{"family":"Ter Steege","given":"Hans"},{"family":"Liang","given":"Jingjing"},{"family":"de‐Miguel","given":"Sergio"},{"family":"Nabuurs","given":"Gert‐Jan"},{"family":"Reich","given":"Peter B."},{"family":"Abegg","given":"Meinrad"},{"family":"Adou Yao","given":"C.

  {"id":"hoyosDengueModelsBased2021","abstract":"Background: Dengue modeling is a research topic that has increased in recent years. Early prediction and decision-making are key factors to control dengue. This Systematic Literature Review (SLR) analyzes three modeling approaches of dengue: diagnostic, epidemic, intervention. These approaches require models of pre­ diction, prescription and optimization. This SLR establishes the state-of-the-art in dengue modeling, using ma­ chine learning, in the last years.\nMethods: Several databases were selected to search the articles. The selection was made based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology. Sixty-four articles were obtained and analyzed to describe their strengths and limitations. Finally, challenges and opportunities for research on machine-learning for dengue modeling were identified.\nResults: Logistic regression was the most used modeling approach for the diagnosis of dengue (59.1%). The analysis of the epidemic approach showed that linear regression (17.4%) is the most used technique within the spatial analysis.

Models that manage uncertainty can also be helpful, because of low data-quality in healthcare.

  {"id":"huaEcologicalFilteringShapes2024","abstract":"The biodiversity impacts of agricultural deforestation vary widely across regions. Previous efforts to explain this variation have focused exclusively on the landscape features and management regimes of agricultural systems, neglecting the potentially critical role of ecological filtering in shaping deforestation tolerance of extant species assemblages at large geographical scales via selection for functional traits. Here we provide a large-scale test of this role using a global database of species abundance ratios between matched agricultural and native forest sites that comprises 71 avian assemblages reported in 44 primary studies, and a companion database of 10 functional traits for all 2,647 species involved. Using meta-analytic, phylogenetic and multivariate methods, we show that beyond agricultural features, filtering by the extent of natural environmental variability and the severity of historical anthropogenic deforestation shapes the varying deforestation impacts across species assemblages. For assemblages under greater environmental variability—proxied by drier and more seasonal climates under a greater disturbance regime—and longer deforestation histories, filtering has attenuated the negative impacts of current deforestation by selecting for functional traits linked to stronger deforestation tolerance. Our study provides a previously largely missing piece of knowledge in understanding and managing the biodiversity consequences of deforestation by agricultural deforestation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Hua","given":"Fangyuan"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Weiyi"},{"family":"Nakagawa","given":"Shinichi"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Shuangqi"},{"family":"Miao","given":"Xinran"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Le"},{"family":"Du","given":"Zhenrong"},{"family":"Abrahamczyk","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Arias-Sosa","given":"Luis Alejandro"},{"family":"Buda","given":"Kinga"},{"family":"Budka","given":"Michał"},{"family":"Carrière","given":"Stéphanie M."},{"family":"Chandler","given":"Richard B."},{"family":"Chiatante","given":"Gianpasquale"},{"family":"Chiawo","given":"David O."},{"family":"Cresswell","given":"Will"},{"family":"Echeverri","given":"Alejandra"},{"family":"Goodale","given":"Eben"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Guohualing"},{"family":"Hulme","given":"Mark F."},{"family":"Hutto","given":"Richard L."},{"family":"Imboma","given":"Titus S."},{"family":"Jarrett","given":"Crinan"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Zhigang"},{"family":"Kati","given":"Vassiliki I."},{"family":"King","given":"David I."},{"family":"Kmecl","given":"Primož"},{"family":"Li","given":"Na"},{"family":"Lövei","given":"Gábor L."},{"family":"Macchi","given":"Leandro"},{"family":"MacGregor-Fors","given":"Ian"},{"family":"Martin","given":"Emily A."},{"family":"Mira","given":"António"},{"family":"Morelli","given":"Federico"},{"family":"Ortega-Álvarez","given":"Rubén"},{"family":"Quan","given":"Rui-Chang"},{"family":"Salgueiro","given":"Pedro A."},{"family":"Santos","given":"Sara M."},{"family":"Shahabuddin","given":"Ghazala"},{"family":"Socolar","given":"Jacob B."},{"family":"Soh","given":"Malcolm C.

  {"id":"hubauAsynchronousCarbonSink2020","abstract":"Structurally intact tropical forests sequestered about half of the global terrestrial carbon uptake over the 1990s and early 2000s, removing about 15 per cent of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions1–3. Climate-driven vegetation models typically predict that this tropical forest ‘carbon sink’ will continue for decades4,5. Here we assess trends in the carbon sink using 244 structurally intact African tropical forests spanning 11 countries, compare them with 321 published plots from Amazonia and investigate the underlying drivers of the trends. The carbon sink in live aboveground biomass in intact African tropical forests has been stable for the three decades to 2015, at 0.66 tonnes of carbon per hectare per year (95 per cent confidence interval 0.53–0.79), in contrast to the long-term decline in Amazonian forests6. Therefore the carbon sink responses of Earth’s two largest expanses of tropical forest have diverged. The difference is largely driven by carbon losses from tree mortality, with no detectable multi-decadal trend in Africa and a long-term increase in Amazonia. Both continents show increasing tree growth, consistent with the expected net effect of rising atmospheric carbon dioxide and air temperature7–9. Despite the past stability of the African carbon sink, our most intensively monitored plots suggest a post-2010 increase in carbon losses, delayed compared to Amazonia, indicating asynchronous carbon sink saturation on the two continents. A statistical model including carbon dioxide, temperature, drought and forest dynamics accounts for the observed trends and indicates a long-term future decline in the African sink, whereas the Amazonian sink continues to weaken rapidly. Overall, the uptake of carbon into Earth’s intact tropical forests peaked in the 1990s. Given that the global terrestrial carbon sink is increasing in size, independent observations indicating greater recent carbon uptake into the Northern Hemisphere landmass10 reinforce our conclusion that the intact tropical forest carbon sink has already peaked. This saturation and ongoing decline of the tropical forest carbon sink has consequences for policies intended to stabilize Earth’s climate.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Hubau","given":"Wannes"},{"family":"Lewis","given":"Simon L."},{"family":"Phillips","given":"Oliver L."},{"family":"Affum-Baffoe","given":"Kofi"},{"family":"Beeckman","given":"Hans"},{"family":"Cuní-Sanchez","given":"Aida"},{"family":"Daniels","given":"Armandu K."},{"family":"Ewango","given":"Corneille E.

  {"id":"hubbellNeutralTheoryEvolution2006","abstract":"Since the publication of the unified neutral theory in 2001, there has been much discussion of the theory, pro and con. The hypothesis of ecological equivalence is the fundamental yet controversial idea behind neutral theory. Assuming trophically similar species are demographically alike (symmetric) on a per capita basis is only an approximation, but it is equivalent to asking: How many of the patterns of ecological communities are the result of species similarities, rather than of species differences? The strategy behind neutral theory is to see how far one can get with the simplification of assuming ecological equivalence before introducing more complexity. In another paper, I review the empirical evidence that led me to hypothesize ecological equivalence among many of the tree species in the species-rich tropical forest on Barro Colorado Island (BCI). In this paper, I develop a simple model for the evolution of ecological equivalence or niche convergence, using as an example evolution of the suite of life history traits characteristic of shade tolerant tropical tree species. Although the model is simple, the conclusions from it seem likely to be robust. I conclude that ecological equivalence for resource use are likely to evolve easily and often, especially in species-rich communities that are dispersal and recruitment limited. In the case of the BCI forest, tree species are strongly dispersal- and recruitment-limited, not only because of restricted seed dispersal, but also because of low recruitment success due to heavy losses of the seedling stages to predators and pathogens and other abiotic stresses such as drought. These factors and the high species richness of the community strongly reduce the potential for competitive exclusion of functionally equivalent or nearly equivalent species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Hubbell","given":"Stephen P."}],"citation-key":"hubbellNeutralTheoryEvolution2006","container-title":"Ecology","DOI":"10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87[1387:NTATEO]2.0.CO;2","ISSN":"1939-9170","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2006 by the Ecological Society of America","page":"1387-1398","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Neutral Theory and the Evolution of Ecological Equivalence","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/0012-9658%282006%2987%5B1387%3ANTATEO%5D2.0.CO%3B2","volume":"87"},
  {"id":"hughesSmallerHumanPopulations2023","abstract":"Human population (often treated as overpopulation) has long been blamed as the main cause of biodiversity loss. Whilst this simplistic explanation may seem convenient, understanding the accuracy of the statement is crucial to develop effective priorities and targets to manage and reverse ongoing biodiversity loss. If untrue, the assertion may undermine practical and effective measures currently underway to counter biodiversity loss by distracting from true drivers, alienating some of the most diverse countries in the world, and failing to tackle the structural inequalities which may be behind global biodiversity declines. Through examining the drivers of biodiversity loss in highly biodiverse countries, we show that it is not population driving the loss of habitats, but rather the growth of commodities for export, particularly soybean and oil-palm, primarily for livestock feed or biofuel consumption in higher income economies. Thus, inequitable consumption drives global biodiversity loss, whilst population is used to scapegoat responsibility. Instead, the responsibilities are clear and have recently been summarized by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services IPBES: Leverage points for biodiversity conservation lie in reducing unsustainable consumption through diet shifts, tracking supply chains, and technological innovation as well as ensuring sustainable production to reduce biodiversity losses associated with industrial agriculture.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Hughes","given":"Alice C."},{"family":"Tougeron","given":"Kévin"},{"family":"Martin","given":"Dominic A."},{"family":"Menga","given":"Filippo"},{"family":"Rosado","given":"Bruno H.P."},{"family":"Villasante","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Madgulkar","given":"Shweta"},{"family":"Gonçalves","given":"Fernando"},{"family":"Geneletti","given":"Davide"},{"family":"Diele-Viegas","given":"Luisa Maria"},{"family":"Berger","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Colla","given":"Sheila R."},{"family":"De Andrade Kamimura","given":"Vitor"},{"family":"Caggiano","given":"Holly"},{"family":"Melo","given":"Felipe"},{"family":"De Oliveira Dias","given":"Marcelo Guilherme"},{"family":"Kellner","given":"Elke"},{"family":"Do Couto","given":"Edivando Vitor"}],"citation-key":"hughesSmallerHumanPopulations2023","container-title":"Biological Conservation","container-title-short":"Biological Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/j.biocon.2022.109841","ISSN":"00063207","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1]]},"language":"en","page":"109841","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Smaller human populations are neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for biodiversity conservation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006320722003949","volume":"277"},
  {"id":"hunkaNASAGEDIESA2023","abstract":"Abstract\n            Earth Observation data are uniquely positioned to estimate forest aboveground biomass density (AGBD) in accordance with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) principles of ‘transparency, accuracy, completeness, consistency and comparability’. However, the use of space-based AGBD maps for national-level reporting to the UNFCCC is nearly non-existent as of 2023, the end of the first global stocktake (GST). We conduct an evidence-based comparison of AGBD estimates from the NASA Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation and ESA Climate Change Initiative, describing differences between the products and National Forest Inventories (NFIs), and suggesting how science teams must align efforts to inform the next GST. Between the products, in the tropics, the largest differences in estimated AGBD are primarily in the Congolese lowlands and east/southeast Asia. Where NFI data were acquired (Peru, Mexico, Lao PDR and 30 regions of Spain), both products show strong correlation to NFI-estimated AGBD, with no systematic deviations. The AGBD-richest stratum of these, the Peruvian Amazon, is accurately estimated in both. These results are remarkably promising, and to support the operational use of AGB map products for policy reporting, we describe targeted ways to align products with Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines. We recommend moving towards consistent statistical terminology, and aligning on a rigorous framework for uncertainty estimation, supported by the provision of open-science codes for large-area assessments that comprehensively report uncertainty. Further, we suggest the provision of objective and open-source guidance to integrate NFIs with multiple AGBD products, aiming to enhance the precision of national estimates. Finally, we describe and encourage the release of user-friendly product documentation, with tools that produce AGBD estimates directly applicable to the IPCC guideline methodologies. With these steps, space agencies can convey a comparable, reliable and consistent message on global biomass estimates to have actionable policy impact.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Hunka","given":"Neha"},{"family":"Santoro","given":"Maurizio"},{"family":"Armston","given":"John"},{"family":"Dubayah","given":"Ralph"},{"family":"McRoberts","given":"Ronald E"},{"family":"Næsset","given":"Erik"},{"family":"Quegan","given":"Shaun"},{"family":"Urbazaev","given":"Mikhail"},{"family":"Pascual","given":"Adrián"},{"family":"May","given":"Paul B"},{"family":"Minor","given":"David"},{"family":"Leitold","given":"Veronika"},{"family":"Basak","given":"Paromita"},{"family":"Liang","given":"Mengyu"},{"family":"Melo","given":"Joana"},{"family":"Herold","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Málaga","given":"Natalia"},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Sylvia"},{"family":"Durán Montesinos","given":"Patricia"},{"family":"Arana","given":"Alexs"},{"family":"Ernesto De La Cruz Paiva","given":"Ricardo"},{"family":"Ferrand","given":"Jeremy"},{"family":"Keoka","given":"Somphavy"},{"family":"Guerra-Hernández","given":"Juan"},{"family":"Duncanson","given":"Laura"}],"citation-key":"hunkaNASAGEDIESA2023","container-title":"Environmental Research Letters","container-title-short":"Environ.

  {"id":"hurtadoLongtermTransmissionPatterns2020","abstract":"Background:  The present study provides a countrywide perspective of the malaria situation in Panamá over a longterm framework, with the purpose of identifying historical malaria resurgence events and their potential causes.\nMethods:  A descriptive-ecological study was conducted by analysing demographic and epidemiological annual malaria time series data in Panamá (1884–2019) using several data sources. Malaria intensity indicators were calculated during the study period. The effects of El Niño Southern Oscillation on malaria transmission were also analysed using a retrospective analysis of malaria cases between 1957 and 2019.\nResults:  Several factors were identified responsible for malaria resurgence in Panamá, mostly related with Malaria Control Programme weakening. During the past 20 years (2000–2019) malaria has progressively increased in prevalence within indigenous settlements, with a predominance of male cases and a high proportion (15% of total cases) in children less than 5 years old. During this period, a significant and increasing proportion of the Plasmodium falciparum cases were imported. Retrospective analysis (1957–2019) evidenced that ENSO had a significant impact on malaria transmission dynamics in Panamá.\nConclusions:  Data analysis confirmed that although authorities have been successful in focalizing malaria transmission in the country, there are still neglected issues to be solved and important intercultural barriers that need to be addressed in order to achieve elimination of the disease by 2022. This information will be useful for targeting strategies by the National Malaria Elimination Programme.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Hurtado","given":"Lisbeth"},{"family":"Cumbrera","given":"Alberto"},{"family":"Rigg","given":"Chystrie"},{"family":"Perea","given":"Milixa"},{"family":"Santamaría","given":"Ana María"},{"family":"Chaves","given":"Luis Fernando"},{"family":"Moreno","given":"Dianik"},{"family":"Romero","given":"Luis"},{"family":"Lasso","given":"Jose"},{"family":"Caceres","given":"Lorenzo"},{"family":"Saldaña","given":"Azael"},{"family":"Calzada","given":"Jose E."}],"citation-key":"hurtadoLongtermTransmissionPatterns2020","container-title":"Malaria Journal","container-title-short":"Malar J","DOI":"10.1186/s12936-020-03329-y","ISSN":"1475-2875","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",12]]},"language":"en","page":"265","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Long-term transmission patterns and public health policies leading to malaria elimination in Panamá","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12936-020-03329-y","volume":"19"},

However, biodiversity loss is expected to occur due to climate change with severe impacts to tropical forests. Using data from a ca. 15 year-old tropical planted forest, we construct models based on a bootstrapping procedure to measure growth and mortality among different species richness treatments in response to extreme climate events. In contrast to higher richness mixtures, in one-species plots we find growth is strongly regulated by climate events and we also find increasingly higher mortality during a consecutive three year dry event. Based on these results together with indicators of loss of resilience, we infer an effect of diversity on critical slowing down.

  {"id":"jakovacLandUseFilter2016","abstract":"Questions: Secondary succession in the tropics can follow alternative pathways. Land-use history is known to engender alternative successional communities, but the underlying mechanisms driving and sustaining divergence remain unclear. In this study we aim to answer the following questions: (1) does previous land use act as a filter for species composition in secondary forests; and (2) what are the relative roles of management practices, soil properties and landscape composition in determining species composition?. Location: Central Amazon, Brazil. Methods: We sampled trees, shrubs and palms (≥1cm diameter) in 38 early secondary forests (5 yr after abandonment) located along gradients of land-use intensity in five shifting cultivation landscapes. We measured the diameter and height of each sampled plant, identified it to species or morpho-species level and checked if it was resprouting or not. At each secondary forest we also collected soil samples for chemical and physical analyses and estimated the amount of old-growth forest surrounding it (landscape composition). Results: We found that previous land-use intensity determined species composition. With increasing land-use intensity, management practices of cut-and-burn and associated reduction in soil quality filtered out seed-dependent species and favoured strong sprouters and species that can cope with low nutrient availability. Landscape composition had a weak effect on species assemblages. We found specific species assemblages and indicator species associated with different levels of previous land-use intensity. As a consequence of these local filters, species α- and β-diversity decreased and therefore early successional communities became more similar to each other. Conclusion: Species composition of successional forests is strongly determined by different land-use intensities. Dispersal limitation has a limited effect on determining the composition of the dominant species. Filtering effects of management practices and soil quality determine the species dominating the canopy at early stages of succession and narrow down the range of species able to colonize and establish. This study highlights how land use shapes successional communities and suggests that alternative successional pathways are determined at early stages of succession. Therefore, accounting for land-use history is crucial to improve the understanding of tropical secondary succession. We present a list of indicator species for different levels of previous land-use intensity that can be used to support conservation and restoration decisions in the Amazon.","author":[{"family":"Jakovac","given":"Catarina C."},{"family":"Bongers","given":"Frans"},{"family":"Kuyper","given":"Thomas W."},{"family":"Mesquita","given":"Rita C.

Swidden cultivation is the traditional agricultural system in riverine Amazonia, which supports local livelihoods and transforms landscapes. In the last decades, riverine Amazonia has been undergoing important transformations related to population migration and market integration. In this study I investigated whether these socio-economic transformations could be inducing agricultural intensification and what are the consequences of such intensification for the resilience of the swidden cultivation systems in the region of the middle-Amazonas river, Brazil. This region is one of the largest producers of cassava flour (farinha in Portuguese) in the Brazilian Amazon, which is the local staple food. By combining information from field surveys, farmers interviews and remote sensing time-series, I investigated how agricultural intensification is taking place at the landscape level, and what are the consequences for secondary forests (fallows) regrowth and swiddens productivity. The results of this study show that swidden cultivation has been intensified in the last three decades, evidenced by an increase in the frequency of swidden-fallow cycles and a decrease in the length of the fallow period, from 9 to 5 years on average. I also found that agricultural intensification was associated to land accessibility and market orientation. Across the region, swiddens are dominated by a single cassava variety that is preferred by the market, reducing the possibilities for adaptation to pests outbreaks and environmental variations. At the field level, repeated swidden-fallow cycles under a short-fallow-period regime (of 5 yrs) leads to a decrease in the recovery capacity of secondary forests (reduced regrowth rate, lower species alpha- and beta-diversity, and changed species composition). Intensification also leads to a reduction in the labour productivity of swiddens (reduced cassava yield and higher weeding labour demand), and consequently in household income. I found that management-environment feedbacks play a key role in the decrease of swiddens and fallows productivity. The sprouting and persistent species favoured by cutting, burning and weeding practices are slow growing and form secondary forests with limited potential to fertilize the next cropping field and to suppress weeds. This results in a higher demand for weeding, which in itself will further favour strong-sprouting species. Such feedbacks reinforce the adverse effects of intensification on the environment and for livelihoods. Although farmers recognize thresholds for managing resilience, such as the formation of tired lands (terras cansadas in Portuguese), the combination of a low-nutrient-requiring crop, increasing farinha prices and shortage of accessible land, is encouraging farmers to keep on cultivating in already exhausted lands, and is pushing the system over such threshold. To enhance the resilience of swidden cultivation systems in the context of riverine Amazonia, management-environment feedbacks should be broken and market opportunities should be broadened beyond cassava, to include forest products that can be harvested within the swidden-fallow landscape, such as nuts, fruits and timber from fast-growing species. Thus, the proper management of secondary succession is key for assuring resilience to swidden-fallow landscapes and for promoting the integration of production and nature conservation in human modified landscapes.","author":[{"family":"Jakovac","given":"C.

  {"id":"jakovacStrongFloristicDistinctiveness2022","abstract":"Forests that regrow naturally on abandoned fields are important for restoring biodiversity and ecosystem services, but can they also preserve the distinct regional tree floras? Using the floristic composition of 1215 early successional forests (≤20 years) in 75 human-modified landscapes across the Neotropic realm, we identified 14 distinct floristic groups, with a between-group dissimilarity of 0.97. Floristic groups were associated with location, bioregions, soil pH, temperature seasonality, and water availability. Hence, there is large continental-scale variation in the species composition of early successional forests, which is mainly associated with biogeographic and environmental factors but not with human disturbance indicators. This floristic distinctiveness is partially driven by regionally restricted species belonging to widespread genera. Early secondary forests contribute therefore to restoring and conserving the distinctiveness of bioregions across the Neotropical realm, and forest restoration initiatives should use local species to assure that these distinct floras are maintained.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Jakovac","given":"Catarina C."},{"family":"Meave","given":"Jorge A."},{"family":"Bongers","given":"Frans"},{"family":"Letcher","given":"Susan G."},{"family":"Dupuy","given":"Juan Manuel"},{"family":"Piotto","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Rozendaal","given":"Danaë M.

For a local stability analysis of spatially homogeneous solutions it turns out to be sufficient to know the eigenvalues of this matrix. This is shown for both continuous and discrete time systems. A bookkeeping scheme is presented that facilitates stability analyses by reducing the analysis of a k-species, n-patch system to that of n uncoupled k-dimensional single-patch systems. This is demonstrated in a worked example for a chain of patches. In two applications the method is then used to analyse the stability of the equilibrium of a predator–prey system with a pool of dispersers and of the periodic solutions of the spatial Lotka–Volterra model.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Jansen","given":"Vincent A.A."},{"family":"Lloyd","given":"Alun L."}],"citation-key":"jansenLocalStabilityAnalysis2000","container-title":"Journal of Mathematical Biology","container-title-short":"J Math Biol","DOI":"10.1007/s002850000048","ISSN":"1432-1416","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"232-252","source":"Springer Link","title":"Local stability analysis of spatially homogeneous solutions of multi-patch systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s002850000048","volume":"41"},

There is ample evidence that species distributions are determined by soils and habitat factors at landscape (<104 km2) and regional scales. At local scales (<1 km2), however, habitat factors and species distributions show comparable spatial aggregation, making it difficult to disentangle the importance of niche and dispersal processes. In this article, we test soil resource-based niche assembly at a local scale, using species and soil nutrient distributions obtained at high spatial resolution in three diverse neotropical forest plots in Colombia (La Planada), Ecuador (Yasuni), and Panama (Barro Colorado Island). Using spatial distribution maps of >0.5 million individual trees of 1,400 species and 10 essential plant nutrients, we used Monte Carlo simulations of species distributions to test plant–soil associations against null expectations based on dispersal assembly. We found that the spatial distributions of 36–51% of tree species at these sites show strong associations to soil nutrient distributions. Neutral dispersal assembly cannot account for these plant–soil associations or the observed niche breadths of these species. These results indicate that belowground resource availability plays an important role in the assembly of tropical tree communities at local scales and provide the basis for future investigations on the mechanisms of resource competition among tropical tree species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,16]]},"author":[{"family":"John","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Dalling","given":"James W."},{"family":"Harms","given":"Kyle E."},{"family":"Yavitt","given":"Joseph B."},{"family":"Stallard","given":"Robert F."},{"family":"Mirabello","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Hubbell","given":"Stephen P."},{"family":"Valencia","given":"Renato"},{"family":"Navarrete","given":"Hugo"},{"family":"Vallejo","given":"Martha"},{"family":"Foster","given":"Robin B."}],"citation-key":"johnSoilNutrientsInfluence2007","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.0604666104","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",1,16]]},"page":"864-869","publisher":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","source":"pnas.org (Atypon)","title":"Soil nutrients influence spatial distributions of tropical tree species","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0604666104","volume":"104"},

Variation was observed in the abundance of Anopheles, Aedes, Culex, and Uranotaenia mosquitoes between the different habitat types. Screening of trapped mosquitoes from the different habitats led to the isolation of five uncharacterized viruses of the families Bunyaviridae, Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae, and Rhabdoviridae, as well as an unclassified virus. Polymerase chain reaction screening for these five viruses in individual mosquitoes indicated a trend toward infection with specific viruses in specific mosquito genera that differed by habitat.

  {"id":"kauffmanBiomassNutrientDynamics1993","abstract":"Unprecedented rates of deforestation and biomass burning in tropical dry forests are dramatically influencing biogeochemical cycles, resulting in resource depletion, declines in biodiversity, and atmospheric pollution. We quantified the effects of deforestation and varying levels of slash-fire severity on nutrient losses and redistribution in a second-growth tropical dry forest (\"Caatinga\") near Serra Talhada, Pernambuco, Brazil. Total aboveground biomass prior to burning was ~74 Mg!ha. Nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were highest in litter, leaves attached to slash, and fine wood debris (<0.64 em diameter). While these components comprised only 30% of the prefire aboveground biomass, they accounted for ~60% of the aboveground pools of N and P. Three experimental fires were conducted during the 1989 burning season. In these treatments consumption was 78, 88, and 95% of the total aboveground biomass. As much as 96% of the prefire aboveground N and C pools and 56% of the prefire aboveground P pool was lost during combustion processes. Nitrogen losses exceeded 500 kglha and P losses exceeded 20 kglha in the fires of the greatest severity. With increasing fire severity, the concentrations ofN and Pin ash decreased while the concentration ofCa increased. This indicates greater amounts of these nutrients were volatilized (i.e., greater ecosystem losses occurred) with increasing fire severity. Following fire, up to 47% of the residual aboveground Nand 84% of the residual aboveground P were in the form of ash, which was quickly lost from the site via wind erosion. Fires appeared to have a minor immediate effect on total N, C, or P in the soils. However, soils in forests with no history of cultivation had significantly higher concentrations of C and P than second-growth forests. Based upon the measured losses of nutrients from these single slash-burning events, it would likely require a century or more of fallow for reaccumulation to occur. However, current fallow periods in this region are 15 yr or less.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Kauffman","given":"J.

  {"id":"kauffmanCarbonPoolBiomass2009","abstract":"Current rates of deforestation and the resulting C emissions in the tropics exceed those of secondary forest regrowth and C sequestration. Changing land-use strategies that would maintain standing forests may be among the least expensive of climate change mitigation options. Further, secondary tropical forests have been suggested to have great value for their potential to sequester atmospheric C. These options require an understanding of and capability to quantify C dynamics at landscape scales. Because of the diversity of physical and biotic features of tropical forests as well as approaches and intensities of land uses within the neotropics, there are tremendous differences in the capacity of different landscapes to store and sequester C. Major gaps in our current knowledge include quantification of C pools, rates and patterns of biomass loss following land-cover change, and quantification of the C storage potential of secondary forests following abandonment. In this paper we present a synthesis and further analyses from recent studies that describe C pools, patterns of C decline associated with land use, and rates of C accumulation following secondary-forest establishment - all information necessary for climate-change mitigation options. Ecosystem C pools of Neotropical primary forests minimally range from -141 to 571 Mg/ha, demonstrating tremendous differences in the capacity of different forests to store C. Most of the losses in C and nutrient pools associated with conversion occur when fires are set to remove the slashed forest to prepare sites for crop or pasture establishment. Fires burning slashed primary forests have been found to result in C losses of 62-80% of prefire aboveground pools in dry (deciduous) forest landscapes and 29-57% in wet (evergreen) forest landscapes. Carbon emissions equivalent to the aboveground primary-forest pool arise from repeated fires occurring in the first 4 to 10 years following conversion. Feedbacks of climate change, land-cover change, and increasing habitat fragmentation may result in increases of both the area burned and the total quantity of biomass consumed per unit area by fire. These effects may well limit the capacity for future tropical forests to sequester C and nutrients.

  {"id":"keatingInvestigationCyclicalIncidence2001","abstract":"The purpose of this research was to review the topic of dengue fever transmission and investigate the relationship between seasonal temperature ﬂuctuations and cyclical dengue fever incidence. Data from Puerto Rico (1988–1992) were used to test the model proposed. Dengue fever is a viral disease caused by any one of four antigenically distinct serotypes. It is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes and infects 80 million people per year. Currently, dengue is endemic in speciﬁc tropical and subtropical regions worldwide and epidemic dengue has been reported in the Americas, Asia and some Paciﬁc Islands. Data for Puerto Rico were collected from the NCDC/NOAA and a study conducted by Perez et al. (1994). Multivariate linear regression analysis was used to determine if a relationship exists between the monthly mean temperature lagged and the monthly incidence of dengue fever in Puerto Rico. Statistical signiﬁcance was achieved and a second-order model produced an R2 of 0.71. A residual analysis reveals positive autocorrelation, thus weakening the model’s power to predict monthly dengue incidence. This suggests that other forces or factors related to the history of the herd immunity, the introduction of a new serotype, or demographic transitions are also inﬂuencing the cyclical transmission of dengue fever. Case clustering information, regional dengue distributions, and population density transformations must also be obtained in order to assess the forecasting ability of this model. Additional research is needed to avoid oversimplifying the problem. Without such attempts at establishing signiﬁcant correlations, dengue prevention and control will remain a formidable task for many developing and developed countries. # 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

However, interactions with anthropogenic drivers such as climate change, land use, and invasive species are changing the nature of fire activity and its impacts.

Conservation of Earth’s biological diversity will be achieved only by recognizing and responding to the critical role of fire.

  {"id":"kirbyVariationCarbonStorage2007","abstract":"Despite growing evidence for an effect of species composition on carbon (C) storage and sequestration, few projects have examined the implications of such a relationship for forestry and agriculture-based climate change mitigation activities. We worked with a community in Eastern Panama to determine the average above- and below-ground C stocks of three land-use types in their territory: managed forest, agroforests and pasture. We examined evidence for a functional relationship between tree-species diversity and C storage in each land-use type, and also explored how the use of particular tree species by community members could affect C storage. We found that managed forests in this landscape stored an average of 335 Mg C haÀ1, traditional agroforests an average of 145 Mg C haÀ1, and pastures an average of 46 Mg C haÀ1 including all vegetation-based C stocks and soil C to 40 cm depth. We did not detect a relationship between diversity and C storage; however, the relative contributions of species to C storage per hectare in forests and agroforests were highly skewed and often were not proportional to species’ relative abundances. We conclude that protecting forests from conversion to pasture would have the greatest positive impact on C stocks, even though the forests are managed by community members for timber and non-timber forest products. However, because several of the tree species that contribute the most to C storage in forests were identiﬁed by community members as preferred timber species, we suggest that species-level management will be important to avoiding C-impoverishment through selective logging in these forests. Our data also indicate that expanding agroforests into areas currently under pasture could sequester signiﬁcant amounts of carbon while providing biodiversity and livelihood beneﬁts that the most common reforestation systems in the region – monoculture teak plantations – do not provide.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Kirby","given":"Kathryn R."},{"family":"Potvin","given":"Catherine"}],"citation-key":"kirbyVariationCarbonStorage2007","container-title":"Forest Ecology and Management","container-title-short":"Forest Ecology and Management","DOI":"10.1016/j.foreco.2007.03.072","ISSN":"03781127","issue":"2-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",7]]},"language":"en","page":"208-221","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Variation in carbon storage among tree species: Implications for the management of a small-scale carbon sink project","title-short":"Variation in carbon storage among tree species","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378112707002903","volume":"246"},
  {"id":"korichevaUsesMisusesMetaanalysis2014","abstract":"The number of published meta-analyses in plant ecology has increased greatly over the last two decades. Meta-analysis has made a significant contribution to the field, allowing review of evidence for various ecological hypotheses and theories, estimation of effects of major environmental drivers (climate change, habitat fragmentation, invasive species, air pollution), assessment of management and conservation strategies, and comparison of effects across different temporal and spatial scales, taxa and ecosystems, as well as research gap identification. We identified 322 meta-analyses published in the field of plant ecology between 1996 and 2013 in 95 different journals and assessed their methodological and reporting quality according to standard criteria. Despite significant recent developments in the methodology of meta-analysis, the quality of published meta-analyses was uneven and showed little improvement over time. We found many cases of imprecise and inaccurate usage of the term ‘meta-analysis’ in plant ecology, particularly confusion between meta-analysis and vote counting and incorrect application of statistical techniques designed for primary studies to meta-analytical data, without recognition of the violation of statistical assumptions of the analyses. Methodological issues for meta-analyses in plant ecology include incomplete reporting of search strategy used to retrieve primary studies, failure to test for possible publication bias and to conduct sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of the results, as well as lack of availability of the data set used for the analyses. The use of meta-analysis is particularly common in community ecology, ecophysiology and ecosystem ecology, but meta-analyses in ecophysiology are more likely not to meet standard quality criteria than papers in other subdisciplines. Fewer meta-analyses have been conducted in plant population ecology. Synthesis. Over the past two decades, plant ecologists have embraced meta-analysis as a statistical tool to combine results across studies, and much has been learned as a result. However, as the popularity and usage of meta-analysis in the field of plant ecology has grown, establishment of quality standards, as has been done in other disciplines, becomes increasingly important. In order to improve the quality of future meta-analyses in plant ecology, we suggest adoption of a checklist of quality criteria for meta-analysis for use by research synthesists, peer reviewers and journal editors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Koricheva","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Gurevitch","given":"Jessica"}],"citation-key":"korichevaUsesMisusesMetaanalysis2014","container-title":"Journal of Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/1365-2745.12224","ISSN":"1365-2745","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2014 The Authors.

The model posits that nitrogen-fixing trees could exacerbate climate change globally relative to non-fixing trees by the radiative equivalent of 0.77 Pg C yr−1 under nitrogen deposition rates projected for 2030.

However, CO2 sequestration in forests is radiatively offset by emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas, from forest soils. Reforestation, an important strategy for mitigating climate change, has focused on maximizing CO2 sequestration in plant biomass without integrating N2O emissions from soils. Although nitrogen (N)-fixing trees are often recommended for reforestation because of their rapid growth on N-poor soil, they can stimulate significant N2O emissions from soils. Here, we first used a field experiment to show that a N-fixing tree (Robinia pseudoacacia) initially mitigated climate change more than a non-fixing tree (Betula nigra). We then used our field data to parameterize a theoretical model to investigate these effects over time. Under lower N supply, N-fixers continued to mitigate climate change more than non-fixers by overcoming N limitation of plant growth. However, under higher N supply, N-fixers ultimately mitigated climate change less than non-fixers by enriching soil N and stimulating N2O emissions from soils. These results have implications for reforestation, suggesting that N-fixing trees are more effective at mitigating climate change at lower N supply, whereas non-fixing trees are more effective at mitigating climate change at higher N supply.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Kou-Giesbrecht","given":"Sian"},{"family":"Funk","given":"Jennifer L."},{"family":"Perakis","given":"Steven S."},{"family":"Wolf","given":"Amelia A."},{"family":"Menge","given":"Duncan N.

However, the ever growing human population in the highlands of Africa has led to the deforestation and land coverage changes to create space for more land for cultivation, grazing, and house construction materials needs. This has lead to the creation of suitable breeding habitats, which are in open places. Decrease of canopy and forest cover has led to increased temperature both in outdoors and indoors in deforested areas. This increased temperature has resulted in the shortening of developmental stages of aquatic stages of mosquitoes and sporogony development in adult mosquitoes.MethodAssessment of the effects of deforestation and land coverage changes (decrease), which leads to temperature changes and subsequently increases survivorship of adults and sporogony development in adult mosquitoes’ body was gathered from previous data collected from 2003 to 2012 using different analysis techniques. Habitats productivity, species dynamics and abundance, mosquitoes feeding rates, and sporogony development are presented in relation to temperature changes.ResultsThe effects of temperature rise due to land cover changes in highlands of western Kenya on larval developmental rates, adult sporogony developments, and malaria risk in human population were derived. Vector species dynamics and abundance in relation to land use changes have been found to change with time.ConclusionThis study found that, land cover changes is a key driver for the temperature rise in African highlands and increases the rate of malaria vectors Anopheles gambiae ssp., An.

Several Earth Observation missions have been specifically designed to address this issue, for example, NASA's GEDI, NASA‐ISRO's NISAR and ESA's BIOMASS. Yet, all these missions' products require independent and consistent validation. A permanent, global, in situ, site‐based forest biomass reference measurement system relying on ground data of the highest possible quality is therefore needed. Here, we have assembled a list of almost 200 high‐quality sites through an in‐depth review of the literature and expert knowledge. In this study, we explore how representative these sites are in terms of their coverage of environmental conditions, geographical space and biomass‐related forest structure, compared to those experienced by forests worldwide. This work also aims at identifying which sites are the most representative, and where to invest to improve the representativeness of the proposed system. We show that the environmental coverage of the system does not seem to improve after at least the 175 most representative sites are included, but geographical and structural coverages continue to improve as more sites are added. We highlight the areas of poor environmental, geographical, or structural coverage, including, but not limited to, Canada, the western half of the USA, Mexico, Patagonia, Angola, Zambia, eastern Russia, and tropical and subtropical highlands (e.g. in Colombia, the Himalayas, Borneo, Papua). For the proposed system to succeed, we stress that (1) data must be collected and processed applying the same standards across all countries and continents; (2) system establishment and management must be inclusive and equitable, with careful consideration of working conditions; and (3) training and site partner involvement in downstream activities should be mandatory.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Labrière","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Davies","given":"Stuart J."},{"family":"Disney","given":"Mathias I."},{"family":"Duncanson","given":"Laura I."},{"family":"Herold","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Lewis","given":"Simon L."},{"family":"Phillips","given":"Oliver L."},{"family":"Quegan","given":"Shaun"},{"family":"Saatchi","given":"Sassan S."},{"family":"Schepaschenko","given":"Dmitry G."},{"family":"Scipal","given":"Klaus"},{"family":"Sist","given":"Plinio"},{"family":"Chave","given":"Jérôme"}],"citation-key":"labriereForestBiomassReference2023","container-title":"Global Change Biology","container-title-short":"Global Change Biology","DOI":"10.1111/gcb.16497","ISSN":"1354-1013, 1365-2486","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2]]},"language":"en","page":"827-840","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Toward a forest biomass reference measurement system for remote sensing applications","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.16497","volume":"29"},

However, anthropogenic disturbances cause degradation of the remaining Amazon forest and threaten their future. Among such disturbances, the most important are edge effects (due to deforestation and the resulting habitat fragmentation), timber extraction, fire, and extreme droughts that have been intensified by human-induced climate change. We synthesize knowledge on these disturbances that lead to Amazon forest degradation, including their causes and impacts, possible future extents, and some of the interventions required to curb them.\n            \n            \n              ADVANCES\n              \n                Analysis of existing data on the extent of fire, edge effects, and timber extraction between 2001 and 2018 reveals that 0.36 ×10\n                6\n                km\n                2\n                (5.5%) of the Amazon forest is under some form of degradation, which corresponds to 112% of the total area deforested in that period. Adding data on extreme droughts increases the estimate of total degraded area to 2.5 ×10\n                6\n                km\n                2\n                , or 38% of the remaining Amazonian forests. Estimated carbon loss from these forest disturbances ranges from 0.05 to 0.20 Pg C year\n                −1\n                and is comparable to carbon loss from deforestation (0.06 to 0.21 Pg C year\n                −1\n                ).\n                \n                Disturbances can bring about as much biodiversity loss as deforestation itself, and forests degraded by fire and timber extraction can have a 2 to 34% reduction in dry-season evapotranspiration. The underlying drivers of disturbances (e.g., agricultural expansion or demand for timber) generate material benefits for a restricted group of regional and global actors, whereas the burdens permeate across a broad range of scales and social groups ranging from nearby forest dwellers to urban residents of Andean countries. First-order 2050 projections indicate that the four main disturbances will remain a major threat and source of carbon fluxes to the atmosphere, independent of deforestation trajectories.\n              \n            \n            \n              OUTLOOK\n              Whereas some disturbances such as edge effects can be tackled by curbing deforestation, others, like constraining the increase in extreme droughts, require additional measures, including global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Curbing degradation will also require engaging with the diverse set of actors that promote it, operationalizing effective monitoring of different disturbances, and refining policy frameworks such as REDD+. These will all be supported by rapid and multidisciplinary advances in our socioenvironmental understanding of tropical forest degradation, providing a robust platform on which to co-construct appropriate policies and programs to curb it.\n              \n                \n                  An overview of tropical forest degradation processes in the Amazon.\n                  Underlying drivers (a few of which are shown in gray at the bottom) stimulate disturbances (timber extraction, fire, edge effects, and extreme drought) that cause forest degradation.

  {"id":"laskyRelationshipTreeBiodiversity2014","abstract":"Theory predicts shifts in the magnitude and direction of biodiversity effects on ecosystem function (BEF) over succession, but this theory remains largely untested. We studied the relationship between aboveground tree biomass dynamics (Dbiomass) and multiple dimensions of biodiversity over 8–16 years in eight successional rainforests. We tested whether successional changes in diversity–Dbiomass correlations reﬂect predictions of niche theories. Diversity–Dbiomass correlations were positive early but weak later in succession, suggesting saturation of niche space with increasing diversity. Early in succession, phylogenetic diversity and functional diversity in two leaf traits exhibited the strongest positive correlations with Dbiomass, indicating complementarity or positive selection effects. In mid-successional stands, high biodiversity was associated with greater mortality-driven biomass loss, i.e. negative selection effects, suggesting successional niche trade-offs and loss of fast-growing pioneer species. Our results demonstrate that BEF relationships are dynamic across succession, thus successional context is essential to understanding BEF in a given system.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Lasky","given":"Jesse R."},{"family":"Uriarte","given":"María"},{"family":"Boukili","given":"Vanessa K."},{"family":"Erickson","given":"David L."},{"family":"John Kress","given":"W."},{"family":"Chazdon","given":"Robin L."}],"citation-key":"laskyRelationshipTreeBiodiversity2014","container-title":"Ecology Letters","container-title-short":"Ecol Lett","DOI":"10.1111/ele.12322","editor":[{"family":"Vila","given":"Montserrat"}],"ISSN":"1461023X","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",9]]},"language":"en","page":"1158-1167","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The relationship between tree biodiversity and biomass dynamics changes with tropical forest succession","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.12322","volume":"17"},
  {"id":"lastovickaSentinel2DataEvaluation2020","abstract":"In this article, we investigated the detection of forest vegetation changes during the period of 2017 to 2019 in the Low Tatras National Park (Slovakia) and the Sumava National Park (Czechia) using Sentinel-2 data. The evaluation was based on a time-series analysis using selected vegetation indices. The case studies represented five different areas according to the type of the forest vegetation degradation (one with bark beetle calamity, two areas with forest recovery mode after a bark beetle calamity, and two areas without significant disturbances). The values of the trajectories of the vegetation indices (normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference moisture index (NDMI)) and the orthogonal indices (tasseled cap greenness (TCG) and tasseled cap wetness (TCW)) were analyzed and validated by in situ data and aerial photographs. The results confirm the abilities of the NDVI, the NDMI and the TCW to distinguish disturbed and undisturbed areas. The NDMI vegetation index was particularly useful for the detection of the disturbed forest and forest recovery after bark beetle outbreaks and provided relevant information regarding the health of the forest (the individual stages of the disturbances and recovery mode). On the contrary, the TCG index demonstrated only limited abilities. The TCG could distinguish healthy forest and the gray-attack disturbance phase; however, it was difficult to use this index for detecting different recovery phases and to distinguish recovery phases from healthy forest. The areas affected by the disturbances had lower values of NDVI and NDMI indices (NDVI quartile range Q2–Q3: 0.63–0.71; NDMI Q2–Q3: 0.10–0.19) and the TCW index had negative values (Q2–Q3: −0.06–−0.05)). The analysis was performed with a cloud-based tool—Sentinel Hub. Cloud-based technologies have brought a new dimension in the processing and analysis of satellite data and allowed satellite data to be brought to end-users in the forestry sector. The Copernicus program and its data from Sentinel missions have evoked new opportunities in the application of satellite data. The usage of Sentinel-2 data in the research of long-term forest vegetation changes has a high relevance and perspective due to the free availability, distribution, and well-designed spectral, temporal, and spatial resolution of the Sentinel-2 data for monitoring forest ecosystems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Lastovicka","given":"Josef"},{"family":"Svec","given":"Pavel"},{"family":"Paluba","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Kobliuk","given":"Natalia"},{"family":"Svoboda","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Hladky","given":"Radovan"},{"family":"Stych","given":"Premysl"}],"citation-key":"lastovickaSentinel2DataEvaluation2020","container-title":"Remote Sensing","DOI":"10.3390/rs12121914","ISSN":"2072-4292","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",6,13]]},"page":"1914","title":"Sentinel-2 Data in an Evaluation of the Impact of the Disturbances on Forest Vegetation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/12/1914","volume":"12"},
  {"id":"latawiecNaturalRegenerationBiodiversity2016","abstract":"Natural regeneration offers a cheaper alternative to active reforestation and has the potential to become the predominant way of restoring degraded tropical landscapes at large-scale. We conducted a meta-analysis for tropical regions and quantified the relationships between both ecological and socioeconomic factors and biodiversity responses in naturally regenerating areas. Biogeographic realms, past disturbance, and the human development index (HDI) were used as explanatory variables for biodiversity responses. In addition, we present a case study of large-scale natural regeneration in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest and identify areas where different forms of restoration would be most suitable. Using our dataset for tropical regions, we showed that natural regeneration was predominantly reported within: the Neotropical realm; areas that were intensively disturbed; and countries with medium HDI. We also found that biodiversity in regenerating forests was more similar to the values found in old growth forests in: countries with either low, high, or very high HDI; less biodiverse realms; and areas of less intensive past disturbance. Our case study from Brazil showed that the level of forest gain resulting from environmental legislation, in particular the Brazilian Forest Code, has been reduced, but remains substantial. Complementary market incentives and financial mechanisms to promote large-scale natural regeneration in human-modified agricultural landscapes are also needed. Our analysis provides insights into the factors that promote or limit the recovery of biodiversity in naturally regenerating areas, and aids to identify areas with higher potential for natural regeneration.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Latawiec","given":"Agnieszka E."},{"family":"Crouzeilles","given":"Renato"},{"family":"Brancalion","given":"Pedro H.S."},{"family":"Rodrigues","given":"Ricardo R."},{"family":"Sansevero","given":"Jerônimo B."},{"family":"Santos","given":"Juliana Silveira","dropping-particle":"dos"},{"family":"Mills","given":"Morena"},{"family":"Nave","given":"André Gustavo"},{"family":"Strassburg","given":"Bernardo B."}],"citation-key":"latawiecNaturalRegenerationBiodiversity2016","container-title":"Biotropica","DOI":"10.1111/btp.12386","ISSN":"1744-7429","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"language":"pt","license":"© 2016 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation","page":"844-855","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Natural regeneration and biodiversity: a global meta-analysis and implications for spatial planning","title-short":"Natural regeneration and biodiversity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/btp.12386","volume":"48"},
  {"id":"lauerwaldHowSimulationsLand2020","abstract":"Land-surface models are important tools for simulation of the past, present, and future capacity of terrestrial ecosystems to absorb anthropogenic CO2 emissions. However, fluvial carbon (C) transfers are presently neglected in these models. Using the Amazon basin as a case study, we show that this negligence leads to significant underestimation of the net uptake of atmospheric C while terrestrial C storage changes are overestimated. These biases arise from the fact that C—in reality, leached from soils and exported through the river network—is instead represented as partly being respired and partly being stored in soils. Moreover, these biases scale mainly to the fluvial C export to the coast, despite aquatic CO2 emission to the atmosphere being the major pathway of riverine C exports. We further show that fluvial C transfers may change significantly in response to changes in either hydrology or in atmospheric C uptake by vegetation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Lauerwald","given":"Ronny"},{"family":"Regnier","given":"Pierre"},{"family":"Guenet","given":"Bertrand"},{"family":"Friedlingstein","given":"Pierre"},{"family":"Ciais","given":"Philippe"}],"citation-key":"lauerwaldHowSimulationsLand2020","container-title":"One Earth","container-title-short":"One Earth","DOI":"10.1016/j.oneear.2020.07.009","ISSN":"2590-3322","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",8,21]]},"page":"226-236","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"How Simulations of the Land Carbon Sink Are Biased by Ignoring Fluvial Carbon Transfers: A Case Study for the Amazon Basin","title-short":"How Simulations of the Land Carbon Sink Are Biased by Ignoring Fluvial Carbon Transfers","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590332220303535","volume":"3"},
  {"id":"lauranceAmazonianRainforestIts2018","abstract":"We synthesize findings from one of the world's largest and longest-running experimental investigations, the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP). Spanning an area of ∼1000 km2 in central Amazonia, the BDFFP was initially designed to evaluate the effects of fragment area on rainforest biodiversity and ecological processes. However, over its 38-year history to date the project has far transcended its original mission, and now focuses more broadly on landscape dynamics, forest regeneration, regional- and global-change phenomena, and their potential interactions and implications for Amazonian forest conservation. The project has yielded a wealth of insights into the ecological and environmental changes in fragmented forests. For instance, many rainforest species are naturally rare and hence are either missing entirely from many fragments or so sparsely represented as to have little chance of long-term survival. Additionally, edge effects are a prominent driver of fragment dynamics, strongly affecting forest microclimate, tree mortality, carbon storage and a diversity of fauna. Even within our controlled study area, the landscape has been highly dynamic: for example, the matrix of vegetation surrounding fragments has changed markedly over time, succeeding from large cattle pastures or forest clearcuts to secondary regrowth forest. This, in turn, has influenced the dynamics of plant and animal communities and their trajectories of change over time. In general, fauna and flora have responded differently to fragmentation: the most locally extinction-prone animal species are those that have both large area requirements and low tolerance of the modified habitats surrounding fragments, whereas the most vulnerable plants are those that respond poorly to edge effects or chronic forest disturbances, and that rely on vulnerable animals for seed dispersal or pollination. Relative to intact forests, most fragments are hyperdynamic, with unstable or fluctuating populations of species in response to a variety of external vicissitudes. Rare weather events such as droughts, windstorms and floods have had strong impacts on fragments and left lasting legacies of change. Both forest fragments and the intact forests in our study area appear to be influenced by larger-scale environmental drivers operating at regional or global scales. These drivers are apparently increasing forest productivity and have led to concerted, widespread increases in forest dynamics and plant growth, shifts in tree-community composition, and increases in liana (woody vine) abundance. Such large-scale drivers are likely to interact synergistically with habitat fragmentation, exacerbating its effects for some species and ecological phenomena. Hence, the impacts of fragmentation on Amazonian biodiversity and ecosystem processes appear to be a consequence not only of local site features but also of broader changes occurring at landscape, regional and even global scales.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Laurance","given":"William F."},{"family":"Camargo","given":"José L.

  {"id":"lawrenceUnseenEffectsDeforestation2022","abstract":"Climate policy has thus far focused solely on carbon stocks and sequestration to evaluate the potential of forests to mitigate global warming. These factors are used to assess the impacts of different drivers of deforestation and forest degradation as well as alternative forest management. However, when forest cover, structure and composition change, shifts in biophysical processes (the water and energy balances) may enhance or diminish the climate effects of carbon released from forest aboveground biomass. The net climate impact of carbon effects and biophysical effects determines outcomes for forest and agricultural species as well as the humans who depend on them. Evaluating the net impact is complicated by the disparate spatio-temporal scales at which they operate. Here we review the biophysical mechanisms by which forests influence climate and synthesize recent work on the biophysical climate forcing of forests across latitudes. We then combine published data on the biophysical effects of deforestation on climate by latitude with a new analysis of the climate impact of the CO2 in forest aboveground biomass by latitude to quantitatively assess how these processes combine to shape local and global climate. We find that tropical deforestation leads to strong net global warming as a result of both CO2 and biophysical effects. From the tropics to a point between 30°N and 40°N, biophysical cooling by standing forests is both local and global, adding to the global cooling effect of CO2 sequestered by forests. In the mid-latitudes up to 50°N, deforestation leads to modest net global warming as warming from released forest carbon outweighs a small opposing biophysical cooling. Beyond 50°N large scale deforestation leads to a net global cooling due to the dominance of biophysical processes (particularly increased albedo) over warming from CO2 released. Locally at all latitudes, forest biophysical impacts far outweigh CO2 effects, promoting local climate stability by reducing extreme temperatures in all seasons and times of day. The importance of forests for both global climate change mitigation and local adaptation by human and non-human species is not adequately captured by current carbon-centric metrics, particularly in the context of future climate warming.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Lawrence","given":"Deborah"},{"family":"Coe","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Walker","given":"Wayne"},{"family":"Verchot","given":"Louis"},{"family":"Vandecar","given":"Karen"}],"citation-key":"lawrenceUnseenEffectsDeforestation2022","container-title":"Frontiers in Forests and Global Change","ISSN":"2624-893X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"source":"Frontiers","title":"The Unseen Effects of Deforestation: Biophysical Effects on Climate","title-short":"The Unseen Effects of Deforestation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/ffgc.2022.756115","volume":"5"},
  {"id":"leclereBendingCurveTerrestrial2020","abstract":"Increased efforts are required to prevent further losses to terrestrial biodiversity and the ecosystem services that it  provides1,2. Ambitious targets have been proposed, such as reversing the declining trends in biodiversity3; however, just feeding the growing human population will make this a challenge4. Here we use an ensemble of land-use and biodiversity models to assess whether—and how—humanity can reverse the declines in terrestrial biodiversity caused by habitat conversion, which is a major threat to biodiversity5. We show that immediate efforts, consistent with the broader sustainability agenda but of unprecedented ambition and coordination, could enable the provision of food for the growing human population while reversing the global terrestrial biodiversity trends caused by habitat conversion. If we decide to increase the extent of land under conservation management, restore degraded land and generalize landscape-level conservation planning, biodiversity trends from habitat conversion could become positive by the mid-twenty-first century on average across models (confidence interval, 2042–2061), but this was not the case for all models. Food prices could increase and, on average across models, almost half (confidence interval, 34–50%) of the future biodiversity losses could not be avoided. However, additionally tackling the drivers of land-use change could avoid conflict with affordable food provision and reduces the environmental effects of the food-provision system. Through further sustainable intensification and trade, reduced food waste and more plant-based human diets, more than two thirds of future biodiversity losses are avoided and the biodiversity trends from habitat conversion are reversed by 2050 for almost all of the models. Although limiting further loss will remain challenging in several biodiversity-rich regions, and other threats—such as climate change—must be addressed to truly reverse the declines in biodiversity, our results show that ambitious conservation efforts and food system transformation are central to an effective post-2020 biodiversity strategy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Leclère","given":"David"},{"family":"Obersteiner","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Barrett","given":"Mike"},{"family":"Butchart","given":"Stuart H.

We find that high biodiversity is 5.7x more important in maximizing biomass than the remaining influence of other ecological and environmental factors. Differences in fish community biomass across space are equally driven by both reductions in the total number of species and the disproportionate loss of larger-than-average species, which is exacerbated at sites impacted by humans.

  {"id":"letcherEnvironmentalGradientsEvolution2015","abstract":"Successional gradients are ubiquitous in nature, yet few studies have systematically examined the evolutionary origins of taxa that specialize at different successional stages. Here we quantify successional habitat specialization in Neotropical forest trees and evaluate its evolutionary lability along a precipitation gradient. Theoretically, successional habitat specialization should be more evolutionarily conserved in wet forests than in dry forests due to more extreme microenvironmental differentiation between early and late-successional stages in wet forest. We applied a robust multinomial classification model to samples of primary and secondary forest trees from 14 Neotropical lowland forest sites spanning a precipitation gradient from 788 to 4000 mm annual rainfall, identifying species that are old-growth specialists and secondary forest specialists in each site. We constructed phylogenies for the classified taxa at each site and for the entire set of classified taxa and tested whether successional habitat specialization is phylogenetically conserved. We further investigated differences in the functional traits of species specializing in secondary vs. old-growth forest along the precipitation gradient, expecting different trait associations with secondary forest specialists in wet vs. dry forests since water availability is more limiting in dry forests and light availability more limiting in wet forests. Successional habitat specialization is non-randomly distributed in the angiosperm phylogeny, with a tendency towards phylogenetic conservatism overall and a trend towards stronger conservatism in wet forests than in dry forests. However, the specialists come from all the major branches of the angiosperm phylogeny, and very few functional traits showed any consistent relationships with successional habitat specialization in either wet or dry forests. Synthesis. The niche conservatism evident in the habitat specialization of Neotropical trees suggests a role for radiation into different successional habitats in the evolution of species-rich genera, though the diversity of functional traits that lead to success in different successional habitats complicates analyses at the community scale. Examining the distribution of particular lineages with respect to successional gradients may provide more insight into the role of successional habitat specialization in the evolution of species-rich taxa.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Letcher","given":"Susan G."},{"family":"Lasky","given":"Jesse R."},{"family":"Chazdon","given":"Robin L."},{"family":"Norden","given":"Natalia"},{"family":"Wright","given":"S.

  {"id":"leungClusteredCatastrophicGlobal2020","abstract":"Recent analyses have reported catastrophic global declines in vertebrate populations1,2. However, the distillation of many trends into a global mean index obscures the variation that can inform conservation measures and can be sensitive to analytical decisions. For example, previous analyses have estimated a mean vertebrate decline of more than 50% since 1970 (Living Planet Index2). Here we show, however, that this estimate is driven by less than 3% of vertebrate populations; if these extremely declining populations are excluded, the global trend switches to an increase. The sensitivity of global mean trends to outliers suggests that more informative indices are needed. We propose an alternative approach, which identifies clusters of extreme decline (or increase) that differ statistically from the majority of population trends. We show that, of taxonomic–geographic systems in the Living Planet Index, 16 systems contain clusters of extreme decline (comprising around 1% of populations; these extreme declines occur disproportionately in larger animals) and 7 contain extreme increases (around 0.4% of populations). The remaining 98.6% of populations across all systems showed no mean global trend. However, when analysed separately, three systems were declining strongly with high certainty (all in the Indo-Pacific region) and seven were declining strongly but with less certainty (mostly reptile and amphibian groups). Accounting for extreme clusters fundamentally alters the interpretation of global vertebrate trends and should be used to help to prioritize conservation efforts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Leung","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Hargreaves","given":"Anna L."},{"family":"Greenberg","given":"Dan A."},{"family":"McGill","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Dornelas","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Freeman","given":"Robin"}],"citation-key":"leungClusteredCatastrophicGlobal2020","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-020-2920-6","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7837","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",12]]},"language":"en","license":"2020 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","number":"7837","page":"267-271","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Clustered versus catastrophic global vertebrate declines","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2920-6","volume":"588"},

We validated our approach using both locational and species holdout sets, and then applied our predictive model to Panama. Using sightings alone (the most common approach) discriminated relative probabilities of occurrences well (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.88), but underestimated actual probabilities by ~4,000%, while using survey data alone omitted over three-quarters of the >6,000 species. Comparatively, S2 BaK had no systematic underestimation, and substantially stronger discrimination (AUC = 0.96) and predictive power (deviance explained = 47%). Our model suggested high diversity (~200% countrywide mean) where urban development is projected to occur (the Panama Canal watershed) and also suggested this is not due to higher sampling intensity. However, portions of the Caribbean coast and eastern Panama (the Darién Gap) were even higher, both for total plant biodiversity (~250% countrywide mean), and CITES listed species. Finally, indigenous territories appeared half as diverse as other regions, based on survey observations. However, our model suggested this was largely due to site selection, and that richness in and out of indigenous territories was roughly equal. In brief, we provide arguably the best estimate of countrywide plant α-diversity and species distributions in the Neotropics, and make >6,000 species distributions available. We identify regions of overlap between development and high biodiversity, and improve interpretation of biodiversity patterns, including for policy-relevant CITES species, and locations with limited access (i.e., indigenous territories). We derive a powerful, flexible, efficient and simple estimation approach for biodiversity science.","author":[{"family":"Leung","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Hudgins","given":"Emma J."},{"family":"Potapova","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Ruiz-Jaen","given":"Maria C."}],"citation-key":"leungNewBaselineCountrywide2019","container-title":"Ecol.

  {"id":"levisPersistentEffectsPreColumbian2017","abstract":"The extent to which pre-Columbian societies altered Amazonian landscapes is hotly debated. We performed a basin-wide analysis of pre-Columbian impacts on Amazonian forests by overlaying known archaeological sites in Amazonia with the distributions and abundances of 85 woody species domesticated by pre-Columbian peoples. Domesticated species are five times more likely than nondomesticated species to be hyperdominant. Across the basin, the relative abundance and richness of domesticated species increase in forests on and around archaeological sites. In southwestern and eastern Amazonia, distance to archaeological sites strongly influences the relative abundance and richness of domesticated species. Our analyses indicate that modern tree communities in Amazonia are structured to an important extent by a long history of plant domestication by Amazonian peoples.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Levis","given":"C."},{"family":"Costa","given":"F.

We combine (i) field observations from 112 plots spanning 300 years of succession in Panamanian tropical forests, and (ii) a new model that resolves nitrogen and light competition at the scale of individual trees.

  {"id":"liangQuantifyingAbovegroundBiomass2023","abstract":"Understanding changes to aboveground biomass (AGB) in forests undergoing degradation is crucial for accurately and completely quantifying carbon emissions from forest loss and for environmental monitoring in the context of climate change. Monitoring forest degradation as compared to deforestation presents technical challenges because degradation involves widespread, low-intensity AGB removal under varying temporal dynamics. Charcoal production is a key driver for forest degradation in Africa and is projected to increase in the future years. In Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where charcoal production drives widespread ABG removal, the utility of optical remote sensing for degradation quantification is challenged by the large inter-seasonal variation and high complexities in ecosystem structure. Limited field measurements on tree structure and aboveground biomass density (AGBD) in many parts of the SSA also impose constraints. In this study, we present a novel data fusion approach combining 3D forest structure from NASA's GEDI Lidar with optical time-series data from Landsat to quantify biomass losses associated with charcoal-related forest degradation over a 10-year time period. We used machine learning models with Landsat spectral indices from the time period of limited hydric stress (LHS) as predictor variables. By applying the best performing Random Forest (RF) model to LandTrendr-stabilized annual LHS Landsat composites, we produced annual forest AGBD maps from 2007 to 2019 over the Mabalane district in southern Mozambique where the dry forest ecosystem was under active charcoal-related degradation since 2008. The RF model achieved an RMSE value of 7.05 Mg/ha (RMSE% = 42%) and R2 value of 0.64 using a 10-fold cross-validation dataset. We quantified a total AGB loss of 2.12 ± 0.06 Megatons (Mt) over the 10-year period, which is only 6.35 ± 2.56% less than the total loss estimated using field-based data as previously published for the same area and time. In addition to quantifying biomass loss, we constructed annual AGBD maps that enabled the characterization of disturbance and recovery. Our framework demonstrates that fusing GEDI and Landsat data through predictive modeling can be used to quantify past forest AGBD dynamics in low biomass forests. This approach provides a satellite-based method to support REDD+ monitoring and evaluation activities in areas where field data is limited and has the potential to be extended to investigate a variety of different disturbance events.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Liang","given":"Mengyu"},{"family":"Duncanson","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Silva","given":"Julie A."},{"family":"Sedano","given":"Fernando"}],"citation-key":"liangQuantifyingAbovegroundBiomass2023","container-title":"Remote Sensing of Environment","container-title-short":"Remote Sensing of Environment","DOI":"10.1016/j.rse.2022.113367","ISSN":"0034-4257","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,1]]},"page":"113367","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Quantifying aboveground biomass dynamics from charcoal degradation in Mozambique using GEDI Lidar and Landsat","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425722004734","volume":"284"},

Here, we used the IDH as a framework to describe the role of forest disturbance in shaping the mosquito community structure, and to identify the ecological processes that increase the emergence of vector-borne disease. Mosquitoes were collected in central Panama at immature stages along linear transects in colonising, mixed and climax forest habitats, representing different levels of disturbance. Species were identified taxonomically and classified into functional categories (i.e., colonist, climax, disturbance-generalist, and rare). Using the Huisman-Olff-Fresco multi-model selection approach, IDH testing was done. We did not detect a unimodal relationship between species diversity and forest disturbance expected under the IDH; instead diversity peaked in old-growth forests. Habitat complexity and constraints are two mechanisms proposed to explain this alternative postulate. Moreover, colonist mosquito species were more likely to be involved in or capable of pathogen transmission than climax species. Vector species occurrence decreased notably in undisturbed forest settings.

We placed\n                CDC\n                light traps in the forest canopy and in the understorey to gather blood‐seeking females.\n              \n            \n            \n              Results\n              \n                We collected 168 405 adult haematophagous dipterans in total, including 26 genera and 86 species. Pristine forest settings were always more taxonomically diverse than the disturbed forest sites, confirming that disturbance has a negative impact on species richness. Species of Phlebotominae and\n                Culicoides\n                were mainly classified as climax (i.e. forest specialist) or disturbance‐generalist, which tend to decrease in abundance along with rising levels of disturbance. In contrast, a significant portion of mosquito species, including primary and secondary disease vectors, was classified as colonists (i.e. disturbed‐areas specialists), which tend to increase in numbers towards more disturbed forest habitats. At pristine forest, the most prevalent species of Phlebotominae and\n                Culicoides\n                partitioned the vertical niche by being active at the forest canopy or in the understorey; yet this pattern was less clear in disturbed habitats. Most mosquito species were not vertically stratified in their habitat preference.\n              \n            \n            \n              Conclusion\n              \n                We posit that entomological risk and related pathogen exposure to humans is higher in pristine forest scenarios for\n                Culicoides and Phlebotominae\n                transmitted diseases, whereas forest disturbance poses a higher entomological risk for mosquito‐borne infections. This suggests that the Dilution Effect Hypothesis (DEH) does not apply in tropical rainforests where highly abundant, yet unrecognised insect vectors and neglected zoonotic diseases occur. Comprehensive, community level entomological surveillance is, therefore, the key for predicting potential disease spill over in scenarios of pristine forest intermixed with anthropogenic habitats.

Les environnements de forêt intacts étaient toujours plus diversifiés du point de vue taxonomique que les sites forestiers perturbés, confirmant que les perturbations avaient un impact négatif sur la richesse en espèces. Les espèces de phlébotome et\n                Culicoïdes\n                étaient principalement classés comme climax (spécialiste de la forêt) ou généralistes de perturbation, qui ont tendance à diminuer en abondance parallèlement aux niveaux croissants de perturbation. En revanche, une partie importante des espèces de moustiques, y compris les vecteurs primaires et secondaires de maladies, a été classée dans la catégorie des colons (c'est‐à‐dire spécialistes des zones perturbées), qui ont tendance à se multiplier vers des habitats forestiers plus perturbés. Dans la forêt vierge, les espèces de phlébotomes et\n                Culicoïdes\n                les plus répandues cloisonnaient la niche verticale en étant actives dans la canopée de la forêt ou dans le sous‐étage; pourtant, cette tendance était moins nette dans les habitats perturbés.

Cela suggère que l'hypothèse de l'effet de dilution ne s'applique pas dans les forêts tropicales humides où se reproduisent très abondamment les insectes vecteurs, mais non reconnus, et où des maladies zoonotiques négligées surviennent. Une surveillance entomologique approfondie au niveau de la communauté est donc la clé pour prédire le potentiel de propagation des maladies dans des scénarios de forêt vierge mélangée à des habitats anthropiques. Nous suggérons que les changements dans la qualité des forêts soient également pris en compte lors de l’évaluation du risque de propagation de maladies transmises par les arthropodes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Loaiza","given":"Jose R."},{"family":"Rovira","given":"Jose R."},{"family":"Sanjur","given":"Oris I."},{"family":"Zepeda","given":"Jesus Altagracia"},{"family":"Pecor","given":"James E."},{"family":"Foley","given":"Desmond H."},{"family":"Dutari","given":"Larissa"},{"family":"Radtke","given":"Meghan"},{"family":"Pongsiri","given":"Montira J."},{"family":"Molinar","given":"Octavio Smith"},{"family":"Laporta","given":"Gabriel Z."}],"citation-key":"loaizaForestDisturbanceVector2019","container-title":"Tropical Medicine & International Health","container-title-short":"Tropical Med Int Health","DOI":"10.1111/tmi.13244","ISSN":"1360-2276, 1365-3156","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",7]]},"language":"en","page":"849-861","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Forest disturbance and vector transmitted diseases in the lowland tropical rainforest of central Panama","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tmi.13244","volume":"24"},

  {"id":"longoImpactsDegradationWater2020","abstract":"Selective logging, fragmentation, and understory ﬁres directly degrade forest structure and composition. However, studies addressing the effects of forest degradation on carbon, water, and energy cycles are scarce. Here, we integrate ﬁeld observations and high‐resolution remote sensing from airborne lidar to provide realistic initial conditions to the Ecosystem Demography Model (ED‐2.2) and investigate how disturbances from forest degradation affect gross primary production (GPP), evapotranspiration (ET), and sensible heat ﬂux (H). We used forest structural information retrieved from airborne lidar samples (13,500 ha) and calibrated with 817 inventory plots (0.25 ha) across precipitation and degradation gradients in the eastern Amazon as initial conditions to ED‐2.2 model. Our results show that the magnitude and seasonality of ﬂuxes were modulated by changes in forest structure caused by degradation. During the dry season and under typical conditions, severely degraded forests (biomass loss ≥66%) experienced water stress with declines in ET (up to 34%) and GPP (up to 35%) and increases of H (up to 43%) and daily mean ground temperatures (up to 6.5°C) relative to intact forests. In contrast, the relative impact of forest degradation on energy, water, and carbon cycles markedly diminishes under extreme, multiyear droughts, as a consequence of severe stress experienced by intact forests. Our results highlight that the water and energy cycles in the Amazon are driven by not only climate and deforestation but also the past disturbance and changes of forest structure from degradation, suggesting a much broader inﬂuence of human land use activities on the tropical ecosystems. Plain Language Summary In the Amazon, timber extraction and forest ﬁres ignited by people are the chief causes of damages that we call forest degradation. Degradation is as widespread as deforestation and changes how forests behave. Degraded forests may pump less water to the atmosphere and absorb less carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. To understand the differences in behavior between degraded and intact forests, we used high‐resolution scanning laser data collected from aircraft ﬂights over regions in the Amazon where we knew if and when forests were degraded. Then, we provided these data to a computer program that calculates the exchange of water and carbon between the forest and the atmosphere. We found that, during the dry season, degraded forests are 6.5°C warmer, pump one‐third less water (i.e., 400,000 L ha−1 month−1), absorb one‐third less carbon (i.e., 1 tonC ha−1 month−1), and show higher ﬁre risk than intact forests. To our surprise, when the Amazon is hit by severe droughts, intact forests start to behave like degraded forests, because all forests run out of water and become hot. Our results are important because they show that forest degradation caused by people can have large impacts on dry‐season climate and favor more ﬁre, especially during typical, nondrought years.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Longo","given":"Marcos"},{"family":"Saatchi","given":"Sassan"},{"family":"Keller","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Bowman","given":"Kevin"},{"family":"Ferraz","given":"António"},{"family":"Moorcroft","given":"Paul R."},{"family":"Morton","given":"Douglas C."},{"family":"Bonal","given":"Damien"},{"family":"Brando","given":"Paulo"},{"family":"Burban","given":"Benoît"},{"family":"Derroire","given":"Géraldine"},{"family":"dos‐Santos","given":"Maiza N."},{"family":"Meyer","given":"Victoria"},{"family":"Saleska","given":"Scott"},{"family":"Trumbore","given":"Susan"},{"family":"Vincent","given":"Grégoire"}],"citation-key":"longoImpactsDegradationWater2020","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences","container-title-short":"JGR Biogeosciences","DOI":"10.1029/2020JG005677","ISSN":"2169-8953, 2169-8961","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",8]]},"language":"en","page":"e2020JG005677","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Impacts of Degradation on Water, Energy, and Carbon Cycling of the Amazon Tropical Forests","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2020JG005677","volume":"125"},
  {"id":"longworthShiftsDominanceSpecies2014","abstract":"Following perturbation, different assemblages that originate under the same abiotic conditions initiate successional pathways that may continue to diverge or converge toward an eventual climax. Forest regeneration in the Central Amazon begins with alternative successional pathways associated with prior land use. In a 12-yr study of secondary forests, initially ranging between 2 and 19 yrs after abandonment, we compared species compositions through time along two pathways, abandoned clear-cuts dominated by Cecropia and abandoned pastures dominated by Vismia; prior results at these sites have not directly evaluated species composition. At all ages, the Chao-Jaccard similarity index of species composition was highest comparing pasture transects to each other, lowest comparing pastures transects to clear-cut transects, and intermediate comparing clear-cut transects to each other. Through time, clear-cut transects became less similar to each other, as did pasture transects. Changes in similarity reflected declining dominance along both pathways, but Cecropia dominance of clear-cut transects declined more rapidly than Vismia dominance of pasture transects. A rich association of species replaced Cecropia in clear-cut transects, resulting in decreased similarity among them. In pasture transects one genus, Bellucia, replaced the lost Vismia, so similarity of Vismia transects was maintained despite some turnover in dominance. Overall, even with turnover of individuals and decline of the dominant pioneers, the alternative pathways exhibited strikingly different species assemblies after two decades of succession, suggesting that the effect of land use persists well beyond initial floristic composition. © 2014 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.","author":[{"family":"Longworth","given":"J.

  {"id":"loweSpatiotemporalModellingClimatesensitive2011","abstract":"This paper considers the potential for using seasonal climate forecasts in developing an early warning system for dengue fever epidemics in Brazil. In the ﬁrst instance, a generalised linear model (GLM) is used to select climate and other covariates which are both readily available and prove signiﬁcant in prediction of conﬁrmed monthly dengue cases based on data collected across the whole of Brazil for the period January 2001 to December 2008 at the microregion level (typically consisting of one large city and several smaller municipalities). The covariates explored include temperature and precipitation data on a 2:51 Â 2:51 longitude–latitude grid with time lags relevant to dengue transmission, an El Nin˜ o Southern Oscillation index and other relevant socio-economic and environmental variables. A negative binomial model formulation is adopted in this model selection to allow for extra-Poisson variation (overdispersion) in the observed dengue counts caused by unknown/unobserved confounding factors and possible correlations in these effects in both time and space. Subsequently, the selected global model is reﬁned in the context of the South East region of Brazil, where dengue predominates, by reverting to a Poisson framework and explicitly modelling the overdispersion through a combination of unstructured and spatio-temporal structured random effects. The resulting spatio-temporal hierarchical model (or GLMM—generalised linear mixed model) is implemented via a Bayesian framework using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Dengue predictions are found to be enhanced both spatially and temporally when using the GLMM and the Bayesian framework allows posterior predictive distributions for dengue cases to be derived, which can be useful for developing a dengue alert system. Using this model, we conclude that seasonal climate forecasts could have potential value in helping to predict dengue incidence months in advance of an epidemic in South East Brazil.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Lowe","given":"Rachel"},{"family":"Bailey","given":"Trevor C."},{"family":"Stephenson","given":"David B."},{"family":"Graham","given":"Richard J."},{"family":"Coelho","given":"Caio A.S."},{"family":"Sá Carvalho","given":"Marilia"},{"family":"Barcellos","given":"Christovam"}],"citation-key":"loweSpatiotemporalModellingClimatesensitive2011","container-title":"Computers & Geosciences","container-title-short":"Computers & Geosciences","DOI":"10.1016/j.cageo.2010.01.008","ISSN":"00983004","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",3]]},"language":"en","page":"371-381","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Spatio-temporal modelling of climate-sensitive disease risk: Towards an early warning system for dengue in Brazil","title-short":"Spatio-temporal modelling of climate-sensitive disease risk","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0098300410001445","volume":"37"},
  {"id":"lugassyWhatEvidenceExists2021","abstract":"Background:  The control and prevention of vector-borne and zoonotic diseases is often based on the reduction of host or vector populations, involving but not limited to preventative culling and use of insecticides. Yet, destructive interventions such as these have shown several limitations including ineffectiveness on arthropods and negative impacts on ecosystems. An alternative strategy would be to rely on the natural ecosystem functions and their careful management to regulate such diseases. The goal of our work was to evaluate existing scientific evidence on poten‑tial links between ecosystem components/functions and 14 vector-borne and zoonotic diseases impacting human health and answer the question: “What evidence exists on the impact of specific ecosystem components and func‑tions on infectious diseases?”.\nMethods:  We searched for scientific articles published in English and French and screened them in a 3-round process (title, abstract and full-text). Articles were retained, without any geographical limitation, if they matched the following eligibility criteria: an exposure/intervention linked to changes in biological communities, habitats, or landscapes; an outcome consisting of any measure of infection in vector, animal or human hosts; and the presence of a comparator, in time and/or in space. The results are presented as a systematic map, followed by a narrative review where the amount of papers allowed for synthesis.\nResults:  Searches in 5 scientific publication databases allowed to retrieve 9723 unique articles, among which 207 were retained after the screening process. The amount of relevant literature was highly variable depending on dis‑eases, and the types of exposures also varied greatly among studies focusing on the same disease. A hundred articles presented in the map were unique in their “disease x exposure” combination and thus not eligible for further narrative description. The remaining 107 articles were organized in 34 “disease x exposure” groups, encompassing 9 out of the 14 initial diseases. The groups were composed of 2 to 16 articles and were examined to provide a description of the current state of knowledge for those diseases.\nConclusion:  Studies investigating the interaction between infectious diseases and ecosystems components and functions are still very scarce, and certain diseases are much more studied than others.

  {"id":"luoMoreRealisticProjections2016","abstract":"Soil carbon (C) is a critical component of Earth system models (ESMs), and its diverse representations are a major source of the large spread across models in the terrestrial C sink from the third to fifth assessment reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Improving soil C projections is of a high priority for Earth system modeling in the future IPCC and other assessments. To achieve this goal, we suggest that (1) model structures should reflect real-world processes, (2) parameters should be calibrated to match model outputs with observations, and (3) external forcing variables should accurately prescribe the environmental conditions that soils experience. First, most soil C cycle models simulate C input from litter production and C release through decomposition. The latter process has traditionally been represented by first-order decay functions, regulated primarily by temperature, moisture, litter quality, and soil texture. While this formulation well captures macroscopic soil organic C (SOC) dynamics, better understanding is needed of their underlying mechanisms as related to microbial processes, depth-dependent environmental controls, and other processes that strongly affect soil C dynamics. Second, incomplete use of observations in model parameterization is a major cause of bias in soil C projections from ESMs. Optimal parameter calibration with both pool- and flux-based data sets through data assimilation is among the highest priorities for near-term research to reduce biases among ESMs. Third, external variables are represented inconsistently among ESMs, leading to differences in modeled soil C dynamics. We recommend the implementation of traceability analyses to identify how external variables and model parameterizations influence SOC dynamics in different ESMs. Overall, projections of the terrestrial C sink can be substantially improved when reliable data sets are available to select the most representative model structure, constrain parameters, and prescribe forcing fields.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Luo","given":"Yiqi"},{"family":"Ahlström","given":"Anders"},{"family":"Allison","given":"Steven D."},{"family":"Batjes","given":"Niels H."},{"family":"Brovkin","given":"Victor"},{"family":"Carvalhais","given":"Nuno"},{"family":"Chappell","given":"Adrian"},{"family":"Ciais","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Davidson","given":"Eric A."},{"family":"Finzi","given":"Adien"},{"family":"Georgiou","given":"Katerina"},{"family":"Guenet","given":"Bertrand"},{"family":"Hararuk","given":"Oleksandra"},{"family":"Harden","given":"Jennifer W."},{"family":"He","given":"Yujie"},{"family":"Hopkins","given":"Francesca"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Lifen"},{"family":"Koven","given":"Charlie"},{"family":"Jackson","given":"Robert B."},{"family":"Jones","given":"Chris D."},{"family":"Lara","given":"Mark J."},{"family":"Liang","given":"Junyi"},{"family":"McGuire","given":"A.

  {"id":"lutzGlobalImportanceLargediameter2018","abstract":"Aim To examine the contribution of large-diameter trees to biomass, stand structure, and species richness across forest biomes. Location Global. Time period Early 21st century. Major taxa studied Woody plants. Methods We examined the contribution of large trees to forest density, richness and biomass using a global network of 48 large (from 2 to 60 ha) forest plots representing 5,601,473 stems across 9,298 species and 210 plant families. This contribution was assessed using three metrics: the largest 1% of trees ≥ 1 cm diameter at breast height (DBH), all trees ≥ 60 cm DBH, and those rank-ordered largest trees that cumulatively comprise 50% of forest biomass. Results Averaged across these 48 forest plots, the largest 1% of trees ≥ 1 cm DBH comprised 50% of aboveground live biomass, with hectare-scale standard deviation of 26%. Trees ≥ 60 cm DBH comprised 41% of aboveground live tree biomass. The size of the largest trees correlated with total forest biomass (r2 = .62, p < .001). Large-diameter trees in high biomass forests represented far fewer species relative to overall forest richness (r2 = .45, p < .001). Forests with more diverse large-diameter tree communities were comprised of smaller trees (r2 = .33, p < .001). Lower large-diameter richness was associated with large-diameter trees being individuals of more common species (r2 = .17, p = .002). The concentration of biomass in the largest 1% of trees declined with increasing absolute latitude (r2 = .46, p < .001), as did forest density (r2 = .31, p < .001). Forest structural complexity increased with increasing absolute latitude (r2 = .26, p < .001). Main conclusions Because large-diameter trees constitute roughly half of the mature forest biomass worldwide, their dynamics and sensitivities to environmental change represent potentially large controls on global forest carbon cycling. We recommend managing forests for conservation of existing large-diameter trees or those that can soon reach large diameters as a simple way to conserve and potentially enhance ecosystem services.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Lutz","given":"James A."},{"family":"Furniss","given":"Tucker J."},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Daniel J."},{"family":"Davies","given":"Stuart J."},{"family":"Allen","given":"David"},{"family":"Alonso","given":"Alfonso"},{"family":"Anderson-Teixeira","given":"Kristina J."},{"family":"Andrade","given":"Ana"},{"family":"Baltzer","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Becker","given":"Kendall M.

  {"id":"macdonaldAmazonDeforestationDrives2019","abstract":"Deforestation and land use change are among the most pressing anthropogenic environmental impacts. In Brazil, a resurgence of malaria in recent decades paralleled rapid deforestation and settlement in the Amazon basin, yet evidence of a deforestation-driven increase in malaria remains equivocal. We hypothesize an underlying cause of this ambiguity is that deforestation and malaria influence each other in bidirectional causal relationships—deforestation increases malaria through ecological mechanisms and malaria reduces deforestation through socioeconomic mechanisms—and that the strength of these relationships depends on the stage of land use transformation. We test these hypotheses with a large geospatial dataset encompassing 795 municipalities across 13 y (2003 to 2015) and show deforestation has a strong positive effect on malaria incidence. Our results suggest a 10% increase in deforestation leads to a 3.3% increase in malaria incidence (∼9,980 additional cases associated with 1,567 additional km2 lost in 2008, the study midpoint, Amazon-wide). The effect is larger in the interior and absent in outer Amazonian states where little forest remains. However, this strong effect is only detectable after controlling for a feedback of malaria burden on forest loss, whereby increased malaria burden significantly reduces forest clearing, possibly mediated by human behavior or economic development. We estimate a 1% increase in malaria incidence results in a 1.4% decrease in forest area cleared (∼219 fewer km2 cleared associated with 3,024 additional cases in 2008). This bidirectional socioecological feedback between deforestation and malaria, which attenuates as land use intensifies, illustrates the intimate ties between environmental change and human health.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,2]]},"author":[{"family":"MacDonald","given":"Andrew J."},{"family":"Mordecai","given":"Erin A."}],"citation-key":"macdonaldAmazonDeforestationDrives2019","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1905315116","issue":"44","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",10,29]]},"page":"22212-22218","publisher":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","source":"pnas.org (Atypon)","title":"Amazon deforestation drives malaria transmission, and malaria burden reduces forest clearing","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1905315116","volume":"116"},
  {"id":"maedaShiftsStructuralDiversity2022","abstract":"Forest edges are an increasingly common feature of Amazonian landscapes due to human-induced forest fragmentation. Substantial evidence shows that edge effects cause profound changes in forest biodiversity and productivity. However, the broader impacts of edge effects on ecosystem functioning remain unclear. Assessing the three-dimensional arrangement of forest elements has the potential to unveil structural traits that are scalable and closely linked to important functional characteristics of the forest. Using over 600 high-resolution terrestrial laser scanning measurements, we present a detailed assessment of forest structural metrics linked to ecosystem processes such as energy harvesting and light use efficiency. Our results show a persistent change in forest structural characteristics along the edges of forest fragments, which resulted in a significantly lower structural diversity, in comparison with the interior of the forest fragments. These structural changes could be observed up to 35 m from the forest edges and are likely to reflect even deeper impacts on other ecosystem variables such as microclimate and biodiversity. Traits related to vertical plant material allocation were more affected than traits related to canopy height. We demonstrate a divergent response from the forest understory (higher vegetation density close to the edge) and the upper canopy (lower vegetation density close to the edge), indicating that assessing forest disturbances using vertically integrated metrics, such as total plant area index, can lead to an erroneous interpretation of no change. Our results demonstrate the strong potential of terrestrial laser scanning for benchmarking broader-scale (e.g. airborne and space-borne) remote sensing assessments of forest disturbances, as well as to provide a more robust interpretation of biophysical changes detected at coarser resolutions.","author":[{"family":"Maeda","given":"Eduardo"},{"family":"Nunes","given":"Matheus"},{"family":"Calders","given":"Kim"},{"family":"Moura","given":"Yhasmin"},{"family":"Raumonen","given":"Pasi"},{"family":"Tuomisto","given":"Hanna"},{"family":"Verley","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Vincent","given":"Gregoire"},{"family":"Zuquim","given":"Gabriela"},{"family":"Camargo","given":"José Luís"}],"citation-key":"maedaShiftsStructuralDiversity2022","container-title":"Remote Sensing of Environment","container-title-short":"Remote Sensing of Environment","DOI":"10.1016/j.rse.2022.112895","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,1]]},"page":"112895","source":"ResearchGate","title":"Shifts in structural diversity of Amazonian forest edges detected using terrestrial laser scanning","type":"article-journal","volume":"271"},

We find that forest landscapes in the tropics were relatively intact, yet these areas experienced the most severe fragmentation over the past two decades. In contrast, 75.1% of the world’s forests experienced a decrease in fragmentation, and forest fragmentation in most fragmented temperate and subtropical regions, mainly in northern Eurasia and South China, declined between 2000 and 2020.

  {"id":"magnuszewskiResilienceAlternativeStable2015","abstract":"Shifting cultivation is a traditional agricultural practice in most tropical regions of the world and has the potential to provide for human livelihoods while hosting substantial biodiversity. Little is known about the resilience of shifting cultivation to increasing agricultural demands on the landscape or to unexpected disturbances. To investigate these issues, we develop a simple social-ecological model and implement it with literature-derived ecological parameters for six shifting cultivation landscapes from three continents. Analyzing the model with the tools of dynamical systems analysis, we show that such landscapes exhibit two stable states, one characterized by high forest cover and agricultural productivity, and another with much lower values of these traits. For some combinations of agricultural pressure and ecological parameters both of these states can potentially exist, and the actual state of the forest depends critically on its historic state. In many cases, the landscapes’ ‘ecological resilience’, or amount of forest that could be destroyed without shifting out of the forested stability domain, declined substantially at lower levels of agricultural pressure than would lead to maximum productivity. A measure of ‘engineering resilience’, the recovery time from standardized disturbances, was independent of ecological resilience. These findings suggest that maximization of short-term agricultural output may have counterproductive impacts on the long-term productivity of shifting cultivation landscapes and the persistence of forested areas.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Magnuszewski","given":"Piotr"},{"family":"Ostasiewicz","given":"Katarzyna"},{"family":"Chazdon","given":"Robin"},{"family":"Salk","given":"Carl"},{"family":"Pajak","given":"Michal"},{"family":"Sendzimir","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Andersson","given":"Krister"}],"citation-key":"magnuszewskiResilienceAlternativeStable2015","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0137497","editor":[{"family":"Adam","given":"Paul"}],"ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",9,25]]},"language":"en","page":"e0137497","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Resilience and Alternative Stable States of Tropical Forest Landscapes under Shifting Cultivation Regimes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0137497","volume":"10"},

We approximated the sensitivity of terrestrial ecosystem respiration to air temperature (Q10) across 60 FLUXNET sites with the use of a methodology that circumvents confounding effects. Contrary to previous findings, our results suggest that Q10 is independent of mean annual temperature, does not differ among biomes, and is confined to values around 1.4 ± 0.1.

  {"id":"malhiExploringLikelihoodMechanism2009","abstract":"We examine the evidence for the possibility that 21st-century climate change may cause a large-scale “dieback” or degradation of Amazonian rainforest. We employ a new framework for evaluating the rainfall regime of tropical forests and from this deduce precipitation-based boundaries for current forest viability. We then examine climate simulations by 19 global climate models (GCMs) in this context and find that most tend to underestimate current rainfall. GCMs also vary greatly in their projections of future climate change in Amazonia. We attempt to take into account the differences between GCM-simulated and observed rainfall regimes in the 20th century. Our analysis suggests that dry-season water stress is likely to increase in E. Amazonia over the 21st century, but the region tends toward a climate more appropriate to seasonal forest than to savanna. These seasonal forests may be resilient to seasonal drought but are likely to face intensified water stress caused by higher temperatures and to be vulnerable to fires, which are at present naturally rare in much of Amazonia. The spread of fire ignition associated with advancing deforestation, logging, and fragmentation may act as nucleation points that trigger the transition of these seasonal forests into fire-dominated, low biomass forests. Conversely, deliberate limitation of deforestation and fire may be an effective intervention to maintain Amazonian forest resilience in the face of imposed 21st-century climate change. Such intervention may be enough to navigate E. Amazonia away from a possible “tipping point,” beyond which extensive rainforest would become unsustainable.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Malhi","given":"Yadvinder"},{"family":"Aragão","given":"Luiz E.

So far, however, policy impact of ES research has been limited. To understand why, we identify five key elements of ES research that help inform decisions by connecting the supply of ES to those who benefit from them. Our structured review of the ES literature reveals that only 13% of assessments included the full ES chain from place to value. Only 7% of assessments considered the distribution of ES benefits explicitly across demographic or other beneficiary groups (for example, private landowners versus the broader public), although disaggregation across regions or spatial units was more common (44%). Finally, crucial mediating factors that affect who benefits and how (for example, the vulnerability of beneficiaries or the availability of substitutes for ES) were considered in only 35% of assessments. Our results suggest that increasing the decision relevance of ES research requires more effectively predicting the impacts of specific decisions on the value and distribution of ES across beneficiary groups. Such efforts will need to integrate ecological models with socioeconomic and cultural dimensions of ES more closely than does the current ES literature.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Mandle","given":"Lisa"},{"family":"Shields-Estrada","given":"Analisa"},{"family":"Chaplin-Kramer","given":"Rebecca"},{"family":"Mitchell","given":"Matthew G.

Using three widely applied but contrasting approaches – species distribution models, individual-based forest models, and dynamic global vegetation models – as examples, we show how scientific and technical advances have led models to transgress their initial objectives and limitations. We provide an overview of recent model applications on current important ecological topics and pinpoint ten key questions that could, and should, be tackled with forest models in the next decade. Synthesis. This overview shows that forest models, due to their complementarity and mutual enrichment, represent an invaluable toolkit to address a wide range of fundamental and applied ecological questions, hence fostering a deeper understanding of forest dynamics in the context of global change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Maréchaux","given":"Isabelle"},{"family":"Langerwisch","given":"Fanny"},{"family":"Huth","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Bugmann","given":"Harald"},{"family":"Morin","given":"Xavier"},{"family":"Reyer","given":"Christopher P.O."},{"family":"Seidl","given":"Rupert"},{"family":"Collalti","given":"Alessio"},{"family":"Dantas de Paula","given":"Mateus"},{"family":"Fischer","given":"Rico"},{"family":"Gutsch","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Lexer","given":"Manfred J."},{"family":"Lischke","given":"Heike"},{"family":"Rammig","given":"Anja"},{"family":"Rödig","given":"Edna"},{"family":"Sakschewski","given":"Boris"},{"family":"Taubert","given":"Franziska"},{"family":"Thonicke","given":"Kirsten"},{"family":"Vacchiano","given":"Giorgio"},{"family":"Bohn","given":"Friedrich J."}],"citation-key":"marechauxTacklingUnresolvedQuestions2021","container-title":"Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1002/ece3.7391","ISSN":"2045-7758","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2021 The Authors.

  {"id":"marleauEmergenceNutrientColimitation2015","abstract":"Evidence that ecosystems and primary producers are limited in their productivity by multiple nutrients has caused the traditional nutrient limitation framework to include multiple limiting nutrients. The models built to mimic these responses have invoked local mechanisms at the level of the primary producers. In this paper, we explore an alternative explanation for the emergence of co-limitation by developing a simple, stoichiometrically explicit meta-ecosystem model with two limiting nutrients, autotrophs and herbivores. Our results show that differences in movement rates for the nutrients, autotrophs and herbivores can allow for nutrient co-limitation in biomass response to emerge despite no local mechanisms of nutrient co-limitation. Furthermore, our results provide an explanation to why autotrophs show positive growth responses to nutrients despite ‘nominal’ top-down control by herbivores. These results suggest that spatial processes can be mechanisms for nutrient co-limitation at local and regional scales, and can help explain anomalous results in the co-limitation literature.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Marleau","given":"Justin N."},{"family":"Guichard","given":"Frédéric"},{"family":"Loreau","given":"Michel"}],"citation-key":"marleauEmergenceNutrientColimitation2015","container-title":"Ecology Letters","DOI":"10.1111/ele.12495","ISSN":"1461-0248","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS","page":"1163-1173","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Emergence of nutrient co-limitation through movement in stoichiometric meta-ecosystems","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ele.12495","volume":"18"},

However, the complexity of spatial models limits their implementation to idealized, regular landscapes. We present a model meta-ecosystem with finite and irregular spatial structure consisting of local nutrient–autotrophs–herbivores ecosystems connected through spatial flows of materials and organisms. We study the effect of spatial flows on stability and ecosystem functions, and provide simple metrics of connectivity that can predict these effects. Our results show that high rates of nutrient and herbivore movement can destabilize local ecosystem dynamics, leading to spatially heterogeneous equilibria or oscillations across the meta-ecosystem, with generally increased meta-ecosystem primary and secondary production. However, the onset and the spatial scale of these emergent dynamics depend heavily on the spatial structure of the meta-ecosystem and on the relative movement rate of the autotrophs. We show how this strong dependence on finite spatial structure eludes commonly used metrics of connectivity, but can be predicted by the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the connectivity matrix that describe the spatial structure and scale.

However, current metacommunity theory largely ignores how the ﬂows of limiting nutrients across ecosystems can inﬂuence communities. We studied a meta-ecosystem model where two autotroph–consumer communities are spatially coupled through the diffusion of the limiting nutrient. We analyzed regional and local stability, as well as spatial and temporal synchrony to elucidate the impacts of nutrient recycling and diffusion on trophic dynamics. We show that nutrient diffusion is capable of inducing asynchronous local destabilization of biotic compartments through a diffusion-induced spatiotemporal bifurcation. Nutrient recycling interacts with nutrient diffusion and inﬂuences the susceptibility of the meta-ecosystem to diffusion-induced instabilities. This interaction between nutrient recycling and transport is further shown to depend on ecosystem enrichment. It more generally emphasizes the importance of meta-ecosystem theory for predicting species persistence and distribution in managed ecosystems.","author":[{"family":"Marleau","given":"Justin N"},{"family":"Guichard","given":"Frédéric"},{"family":"Mallard","given":"François"},{"family":"Loreau","given":"Michel"}],"citation-key":"marleauNutrientFlowsEcosystems2010","container-title":"Journal of Theoretical Biology","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Nutrient flows between ecosystems can destabilize simple food chains","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"marshallConceptualisingGlobalForest2020","abstract":"Lianas are woody vines, rooted in the soil, and supported physically by trees. Lianas contribute to forest ecosystem functioning globally, but especially in the tropics and subtropics. However, proliﬁc liana growth following heavy disturbance frequently affects subsequent recovery of forest tree diversity, biomass, structure, and function. Understanding this forest liana dynamic, and its sensitivity to climate and anthropogenic forces, is essential for worldwide forest restoration and climate change mitigation. Here, we synthesise the evidence for both positive and negative effects of lianas on forests and propose a framework that outlines the expected global response of forests to disturbance-induced liana proliferation. Emerging evidence suggests that lianas play a major role in both facilitating and delaying forest recovery following disturbance. At low levels of disturbance and/or where environmental conditions favour tree growth, lianas can facilitate forest recovery by protecting trees from extreme weather, ﬁre, weed invasion and herbivory. However, under conditions where lianas proliferate beyond critical thresholds, positive feedbacks are expected to induce and sustain liana-dominated forest states that can endure for decades or even longer. We conceptualise alternative classes of forest recovery response to disturbance and describe measurement and modelling of liana thresholds. We identify four essential challenges for global change science relating to lianas: (1) incorporation of lianas and sapling stems into forest monitoring and tree stand measurements worldwide; (2) long-term experiments to determine variation in liana-tree competition, and potential drivers across forest successional gradients; (3) identiﬁcation and prediction of liana thresholds and other alternative forest recovery response classes; and (4) dynamic mechanistic modelling of forest recovery to determine regional and global variation within and among different recovery response classes, in relation to variation in potential drivers, liana feedbacks and their interactions. Addressing these challenges will determine the importance of lianas in shaping regional and global forest composition, recovery and dynamics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Marshall","given":"Andrew R."},{"family":"Platts","given":"Philip J."},{"family":"Chazdon","given":"Robin L."},{"family":"Seki","given":"Hamidu"},{"family":"Campbell","given":"Mason J."},{"family":"Phillips","given":"Oliver L."},{"family":"Gereau","given":"Roy E."},{"family":"Marchant","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Liang","given":"Jingjing"},{"family":"Herbohn","given":"John"},{"family":"Malhi","given":"Yadvinder"},{"family":"Pfeifer","given":"Marion"}],"citation-key":"marshallConceptualisingGlobalForest2020","container-title":"Frontiers in Forests and Global Change","container-title-short":"Front.

  {"id":"martinCarbonPoolsRecover2013","abstract":"Although increasing efforts are being made to restore tropical forests, little information is available regarding the time scales required for carbon and plant biodiversity to recover to the values associated with undisturbed forests. To address this knowledge gap, we carried out a meta-analysis comparing data from more than 600 secondary tropical forest sites with nearby undisturbed reference forests. Above-ground biomass approached equivalence to reference values within 80 years since last disturbance, whereas below-ground biomass took longer to recover. Soil carbon content showed little relationship with time since disturbance. Tree species richness recovered after about 50 years. By contrast, epiphyte richness did not reach equivalence to undisturbed forests. The proportion of undisturbed forest trees and epiphyte species found in secondary forests was low and changed little over time. Our results indicate that carbon pools and biodiversity show different recovery rates under passive, secondary succession and that colonization by undisturbed forest plant species is slow. Initiatives such as the Convention on Biological Diversity and REDD+ should therefore encourage active management to help to achieve their aims of restoring both carbon and biodiversity in tropical forests.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Martin","given":"Philip A."},{"family":"Newton","given":"Adrian C."},{"family":"Bullock","given":"James M."}],"citation-key":"martinCarbonPoolsRecover2013","container-title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc.

  {"id":"martinez-ramosNaturalForestRegeneration2016","abstract":"In human-modified tropical landscapes (HMLs) the conservation of biodiversity, functions and services of forest ecosystems depends on persistence of old growth forest remnants, forest regeneration in abandoned agricultural fields, and restoration of degraded lands. Understanding the impacts of agricultural land uses (ALUs) on forest regeneration is critical for biodiversity conservation in HMLs. Here, we develop a conceptual framework that considers the availability of propagules and the environment prevailing after field abandonment as two major determinants of forest regeneration in HMLs. The framework proposes that regeneration potential decreases with size, duration and severity of agricultural disturbance, reducing propagule availability and creating ill-suited environmental conditions for regeneration. We used studies from Southern Mexico to assess this framework. First, we identify regeneration bottlenecks that trees face during transit from seed to follow-up life stages, using demographic analysis of dominant pioneer species in recently abandoned fields. Then, we explore effects of ALUs on forest regeneration at the field and landscape scales, addressing major legacies. Finally, we integrate agricultural disturbance with landscape composition to predict attributes of successful second growth forests in HMLs, and provide indicators useful to select tree native species for active restoration. An indicator of disturbance inflicted by ALUs, based on farmers’ information, predicted better regeneration potential than measurements of soil and microclimate conditions at time of abandonment. Cover of cattle pastures in the landscape was a stronger indicator of forest regenerating attributes than cover of old growth forest remnants. To conclude, we offer recommendations to promote forest regeneration and biodiversity conservation in HMLs.","author":[{"family":"Martínez-Ramos","given":"Miguel"},{"family":"Pingarroni","given":"Aline"},{"family":"Rodríguez-Velázquez","given":"Jorge"},{"family":"Toledo-Chelala","given":"Lilibeth"},{"family":"Zermeño-Hernández","given":"Isela"},{"family":"Bongers","given":"Frans"}],"citation-key":"martinez-ramosNaturalForestRegeneration2016","container-title":"Biotropica","DOI":"10.1111/btp.12382","ISSN":"0006-3606","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",11]]},"page":"745-757","title":"Natural forest regeneration and ecological restoration in human‐modified tropical landscapes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/btp.12382","volume":"48"},

  {"id":"martinezUsingStatisticalCrop2020","abstract":"In this article, we evaluate the impact of temperature and precipitation at the end of the 21st century (2075–2099) on the yield of maize in the Azuero Region in Panama. Using projected data from an atmospheric climate model, MRI-ACGM 3.2S, the study variables are related to maize yield (t ha−1) under four different sea surface Temperature (SST) Ensembles (C0, C1, C2, and C3) and in three different planting dates (21 August, 23 September, and 23 October). In terms climate, results confirm the increase in temperatures and precipitation intensity that has been projected for the region at the end of the century. Moreover, differences are found in the average precipitation patterns of each SST-ensemble, which leads to difference in maize yield. SST-Ensembles C0, C1, and C3 predict a doubling of the yield observed from baseline period (1990–2003), while in C1, the yield is reduced around 5%. Yield doubling is attributed to the increase in rainfall, while yield decrease is related to the selection of a later planting date, which is indistinct to the SST-ensembles used for the calculation. Moreover, lower yields are related to years in which El Niño Southerm Oscilation (ENSO) are projected to occur at the end of century. The results are important as they provide a mitigation strategy for maize producers under rainfed model on the Azuero region, which is responsible for over 95% of the production of the country.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Martínez","given":"Marlemys M."},{"family":"Nakaegawa","given":"Tosiyuki"},{"family":"Pinzón","given":"Reinhardt"},{"family":"Kusunoki","given":"Shoji"},{"family":"Gordón","given":"Román"},{"family":"Sanchez-Galan","given":"Javier E."}],"citation-key":"martinezUsingStatisticalCrop2020","container-title":"Atmosphere","DOI":"10.3390/atmos11101097","ISSN":"2073-4433","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",10]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"10","page":"1097","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Using a Statistical Crop Model to Predict Maize Yield by the End-Of-Century for the Azuero Region in Panama","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4433/11/10/1097","volume":"11"},

  {"id":"martinuzziPatternsControlsIsland2022","abstract":"Understanding the heterogeneity of biomass accumulation in second-g­ rowth tropical forests following land use abandonment is important for informing ecosystem carbon models and forest restoration efforts. There is an urgent need for a broad sample of second-­growth forests to enhance our knowledge of carbon accumulation in human-­dominated landscapes, especially for older forests. Puerto Rico has predominantly second-­growth forests, ranging in age from approximately 25 to more than 80 years. We used an island-­wide sample of airborne lidar from the NASA Goddard Lidar, Hyperspectral, and Thermal (G-­LiHT) Airborne Imager collected on March 2017, forest inventory data, and data on forest age, precipitation, soils, and land use to estimate aboveground biomass stocks in moist and wet, second-­growth tropical forests. Biomass accumulation rates in Puerto Rico were lower, on average, than in other Neotropical forests. Median biomass across >16,700 ha of older second-­ growth forests was 105 Mg ha−1, and sampled biomass rarely surpassed 250 Mg ha−1. Differences in biomass by age were large and persistent across different substrates and land uses, with a plateau in the pattern of island-­wide biomass accumulation after about 33 years. A spatial regression model showed that multiple factors were related to biomass accumulation, including time since abandonment, geologic substrate, past land use as coffee or pasture, precipitation, topographic wetness index, and slope. Our findings have important consequences for the total carbon storage and expected climate mitigation benefits of large-­scale reforestation efforts, and highlight the value of airborne lidar for quantifying biomass variability in complex tropical landscapes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Martinuzzi","given":"Sebastián"},{"family":"Cook","given":"Bruce D."},{"family":"Helmer","given":"Eileen H."},{"family":"Keller","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Locke","given":"Dexter H."},{"family":"Marcano‐Vega","given":"Humfredo"},{"family":"Uriarte","given":"María"},{"family":"Morton","given":"Douglas C."}],"citation-key":"martinuzziPatternsControlsIsland2022","container-title":"Biotropica","container-title-short":"Biotropica","DOI":"10.1111/btp.13122","ISSN":"0006-3606, 1744-7429","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",9]]},"language":"en","page":"1146-1159","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Patterns and controls on island‐wide aboveground biomass accumulation in second‐growth forests of Puerto Rico","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/btp.13122","volume":"54"},

  {"id":"mateo-vegaTreeAbovegroundBiomass2019","abstract":"The remote forests of the Darien region in eastern Panama are among the last remnants of relatively undisturbed forest habitat in the Central American isthmus. Despite decades of efforts by the government, nongovernmental organizations, and civil society, including Indigenous peoples, to protect the region's natural heritage, it remains under significant threat due to widespread illegal logging. Now, the Panamanian government is considering the mechanism, Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+), as another option to limit forest loss. Central to the proper functioning of REDD+ is the need to reduce uncertainties in estimates of aboveground biomass (AGB). These estimates are used to establish realistic reference levels against which additional contributions to reducing carbon dioxide emissions from the loss and degradation of forests can be financially compensated. Also, highly desirable to REDD+ is the achievement of biodiversity cobenefits. REDD+ investments will likely be directed primarily to areas where the potential to simultaneously mitigate climate change and conserve biodiversity is highest. Here, we present the results of a field-based forest carbon inventorying method tested in Darien's mature forests with the participation of Embera and Wounaan Indigenous peoples. We also explore whether variations in field-based estimates of AGB across mature forests, in both undisturbed and disturbed areas, are detectable through free and readily-available remote sensing data sources. Furthermore, we examine and compare AGB and tree species richness in Darien with other well-studied forest sites across the tropics. Our findings reveal that Darien's forests play a crucial role globally and regionally in storing carbon and housing biodiversity, and support the imperative need to protect these forests in a culturally appropriate manner with the region's Indigenous peoples.","author":[{"family":"Mateo-Vega","given":"Javier"},{"family":"Arroyo-Mora","given":"J.

  {"id":"matosSecondaryForestFragments2020","abstract":"Abstract\n            Tropical forests store large amounts of carbon and high biodiversity, but are being degraded at alarming rates. The emerging global Forest and Landscape Restoration (FLR) agenda seeks to limit global climate change by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through the growth of trees. In doing so, it may also protect biodiversity as a free cobenefit, which is vital given the massive shortfall in funding for biodiversity conservation. We investigated whether natural forest regeneration on abandoned pastureland offers such cobenefits, focusing for the first time on the recovery of taxonomic diversity (TD), phylogenetic diversity (PD) and functional diversity (FD) of trees, including the recovery of threatened and endemic species richness, within isolated secondary forest (SF) fragments. We focused on the globally threatened Brazilian Atlantic Forest, where commitments have been made to restore 1 million hectares under FLR. Three decades after land abandonment, regenerating forests had recovered ~20% (72 Mg/ha) of the above‐ground carbon stocks of a primary forest (PF), with cattle pasture containing just 3% of stocks relative to PFs. Over this period, SF recovered ~76% of TD, 84% of PD and 96% of FD found within PFs. In addition, SFs had on average recovered 65% of threatened and ~30% of endemic species richness of primary Atlantic forest. Finally, we find positive relationships between carbon stock and tree diversity recovery. Our results emphasize that SF fragments offer cobenefits under FLR and other carbon‐based payments for ecosystem service schemes (e.g. carbon enhancements under REDD+). They also indicate that even isolated patches of SF could help to mitigate climate change and the biodiversity extinction crisis by recovering species of high conservation concern and improving landscape connectivity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Matos","given":"Fabio A.

What drives their distribution today and how it may shift in the future are open questions. Feedbacks among climate, fire, herbivory, and land use are known drivers. Here, we show that alternating seasonal drought and waterlogging stress favors the dominance of savanna-like ecosystems over forests. We track the seasonal water-table depth as an indicator of water stress when too deep and oxygen stress when too shallow and map forest/savanna occurrence within this double-stress space in the neotropics. We find that under a given annual precipitation, savannas are favored in landscape positions experiencing double stress, which is more common as the dry season strengthens (climate driver) but only found in waterlogged lowlands (terrain driver). We further show that hydrological changes at the end of the century may expose some flooded forests to savanna expansion, affecting biodiversity and soil carbon storage. Our results highlight the importance of land hydrology in understanding/predicting forest–savanna transitions in a changing world.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Mattos","given":"Caio R.

I also highlight the transmutation principle that identifies serious limitations to the study of large-scale systems with reductionist approaches. And I suggest that much of the underlying goal of macroecology is the pursuit of general principles and the escape from contingency. I highlight that there are many intertwined aspects of macroecology, with a number of resulting implications. I propose that returning to a focus on studying assemblages of a large number of particles is a helpful view.

  {"id":"medina-vegaTropicalTreeEctomycorrhiza2024","abstract":"Mycorrhizae, a form of plant–fungal symbioses, mediate vegetation impacts on ecosystem functioning. Climatic effects on decomposition and soil quality are suggested to drive mycorrhizal distributions, with arbuscular mycorrhizal plants prevailing in low-latitude/high-soil-quality areas and ectomycorrhizal (EcM) plants in high-latitude/low-soil-quality areas. However, these generalizations, based on coarse-resolution data, obscure finer-scale variations and result in high uncertainties in the predicted distributions of mycorrhizal types and their drivers. Using data from 31 lowland tropical forests, both at a coarse scale (mean-plot-level data) and fine scale (20 × 20 metres from a subset of 16 sites), we demonstrate that the distribution and abundance of EcM-associated trees are independent of soil quality. Resource exchange differences among mycorrhizal partners, stemming from diverse evolutionary origins of mycorrhizal fungi, may decouple soil fertility from the advantage provided by mycorrhizal associations. Additionally, distinct historical biogeographies and diversification patterns have led to differences in forest composition and nutrient-acquisition strategies across three major tropical regions. Notably, Africa and Asia’s lowland tropical forests have abundant EcM trees, whereas they are relatively scarce in lowland neotropical forests. A greater understanding of the functional biology of mycorrhizal symbiosis is required, especially in the lowland tropics, to overcome biases from assuming similarity to temperate and boreal regions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Medina-Vega","given":"José A."},{"family":"Zuleta","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Aguilar","given":"Salomón"},{"family":"Alonso","given":"Alfonso"},{"family":"Bissiengou","given":"Pulchérie"},{"family":"Brockelman","given":"Warren Y."},{"family":"Bunyavejchewin","given":"Sarayudh"},{"family":"Burslem","given":"David F.

  {"id":"meliGlobalReviewLand2017","abstract":"Global forest restoration targets have been set, yet policy makers and land managers lack guiding principles on how to invest limited resources to achieve them. We conducted a meta-analysis of 166 studies in naturally regenerating and actively restored forests worldwide to answer: (1) To what extent do floral and faunal abundance and diversity and biogeochemical functions recover? (2) Does recovery vary as a function of past land use, time since restoration, forest region, or precipitation? (3) Does active restoration result in more complete or faster recovery than passive restoration? Overall, forests showed a high level of recovery, but the time to recovery depended on the metric type measured, past land use, and region. Abundance recovered quickly and completely, whereas diversity recovered slower in tropical than in temperate forests. Biogeochemical functions recovered more slowly after agriculture than after logging or mining. Formerly logged sites were mostly passively restored and generally recovered quickly. Mined sites were nearly always actively restored using a combination of planting and either soil amendments or recontouring topography, which resulted in rapid recovery of the metrics evaluated. Actively restoring former agricultural land, primarily by planting trees, did not result in consistently faster or more complete recovery than passively restored sites. Our results suggest that simply ending the land use is sufficient for forests to recover in many cases, but more studies are needed that directly compare the value added of active versus passive restoration strategies in the same system. Investments in active restoration should be evaluated relative to the past land use, the natural resilience of the system, and the specific objectives of each project.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Meli","given":"Paula"},{"family":"Holl","given":"Karen D."},{"family":"Benayas","given":"José María Rey"},{"family":"Jones","given":"Holly P."},{"family":"Jones","given":"Peter C."},{"family":"Montoya","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Mateos","given":"David Moreno"}],"citation-key":"meliGlobalReviewLand2017","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0171368","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",2,3]]},"language":"en","page":"e0171368","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"A global review of past land use, climate, and active vs. passive restoration effects on forest recovery","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0171368","volume":"12"},

Here, we shed light on the assembly rules of a multilayer network formed by frugivory and nectarivory interactions between bats and plants in the Neotropics. By harnessing a conceptual framework known as the integrative hypothesis of specialization, our results suggest that phylogenetic constraints separate species into different layers and shape the network’s modules. Then, the network shifts to a nested structure within its modules where interactions are mainly structured by geographic co-occurrence. Finally, organismal traits related to consuming fruits or nectar determine which bat species are central or peripheral to the network. Our results provide insights into how different processes contribute to the assemblage of ecological systems at different levels of organization, resulting in a compound network topology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Mello","given":"Marco A.

  {"id":"mendesLookThereGap2019","abstract":"Consideration of soil quality indicators is fundamental for understanding and managing ecosystems. Despite the evidence regarding the importance of soil for provision of local and global ecosystem services, such as water regulation and carbon sequestration, soil remains an under-investigated and undermined aspect of the environment. Here we evaluate to what extent soil indicators are taken into account in restoration. We focused on the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, a highly fragmented biome and a global biodiversity hotspot. We conducted a systematic literature review and we showed that the majority (59%) of the studies on restoration did not consider any soil indicator. Studies that demonstrated the importance of soil indicators most commonly reported soil pH (71%, n = 44), followed by potassium content (66%, n = 41) and phosphorus (64.5%, n = 40), while the least reported indicator was water retention (6.5%, n = 4). Only 40% of the retrieved studies included information about reference sites or project baseline information. We complement our literature review with a case study on restoration in two areas of the Atlantic Forest. We found a relation between soil indicators such as soil organic matter, nitrogen, sodium and sand content, and aboveground indicators, confirming a necessity to include soil screening in restoration. Moreover, we found that prior to restoration none of these soil indicators were analyzed. This study highlights the gap that exists in soil data in restoration in studies on the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We urge scientists and practitioners to include basic soil analysis to maximize the successful outcomes of restoration.","author":[{"family":"Mendes","given":"Maiara S."},{"family":"Latawiec","given":"Agnieszka E."},{"family":"Sansevero","given":"Jerônimo B.

Using national-scale forest inventories from the United States and Mexico, we show that the latitudinal abundance distribution of N-fixing trees (more than 10 times less abundant poleward of 35° N) coincides with a latitudinal transition in symbiotic N-fixation type: rhizobial N-fixing trees (which are typically facultative, regulating fixation to meet nutritional demand) dominate equatorward of 35° N, whereas actinorhizal N-fixing trees (typically obligate, maintaining fixation regardless of soil nutrition) dominate to the north. We then use theoretical and statistical models to show that a latitudinal shift in N-fixation strategy (facultative vs. obligate) near 35° N can explain the observed change in N-fixing tree abundance, even if N availability is lower at higher latitudes, because facultative fixation leads to much higher landscape-scale N-fixing tree abundance than obligate fixation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Menge","given":"Duncan N.

Sites which had been clearcut without subsequent use were dominated after 6–10 years by the pioneer genus Cecropia (Moraceae), whereas those used for pasture before abandonment were dominated by the pioneer genus Vismia (Clusiaceae). 2 There were 58 plant families and 300 species identified in Cecropia stands but only 43 families and 147 species were identified in Vismia stands. There were 77 species in common (Sorensen similarity = 0.34). 3 Differences in species number and composition of recruiting individuals between stand types were significant and were a function of the dominant pioneer genus, stem density, distance from primary forest, and land-use history. Regeneration under Vismia canopy was dominated by small Vismia individuals (25% of plants < 2 cm basal diameter), whereas regeneration under Cecropia canopy was more diverse and did not include a single young Cecropia. 4 The number of regenerating plants in both secondary stand types dropped off sharply with distance (5, 25, 50, and 100 m) from primary forest, suggesting that seed dispersal was limiting plant recruitment. Species richness also declined with distance and could be explained by the decline in plant density. Species richness in Cecropia stands increased linearly with plant density, but in Vismia stands the richness increase with density was a decelerating function. 5 For the central Amazon, secondary succession involves a more rapid return of primary forest species if deforestation is not followed by use as pasture before abandonment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Mesquita","given":"Rita C.G."},{"family":"Ickes","given":"Kalan"},{"family":"Ganade","given":"Gislene"},{"family":"Williamson","given":"G.

In a 25-year study, Amazon rain forest regenerated following deforestation as long as seed availability and seedling recruitment were not interrupted. In contrast, rain forest converted to cattle pastures via cutting and burning prior to abandonment diverted succession, leading to highly simplified stands dominated by a single genus. Annual fires eliminated seedlings, saplings, coppice, and seeds in the soil, except for several Vismia species. Once established, Vismia regenerated by continual resprouting and resisted the establishment of other rain forest species, especially the normal suite of pioneers. Through time, succession both in abandoned clearcuts and pastures increased in stem density and biomass; however, species accumulation and ecosystem services were limited in pastures when compared with those in abandoned clearcuts. Therefore, prescribed burning to maintain pastureland leaves a legacy that is not readily extinguished, whereas abandoning clearcuts engenders an accelerated rain forest regeneration.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Mesquita","given":"Rita De Cássia Guimarães"},{"family":"Massoca","given":"Paulo Eduardo Dos Santos"},{"family":"Jakovac","given":"Catarina Conte"},{"family":"Bentos","given":"Tony Vizcarra"},{"family":"Williamson","given":"G.

  {"id":"metzFunctionalTraitsYoung","abstract":"Understanding the mechanisms that promote the coexistence of hundreds of species over small areas in tropical forest remains a challenge. Many tropical tree species are presumed to be functionally equivalent shade tolerant species but exist on a continuum of performance trade-offs between survival in shade and the ability to quickly grow in sunlight. These trade-offs can promote coexistence by reducing fitness differences. Variation in plant functional traits related to resource acquisition is thought to predict variation in performance among species, perhaps explaining community assembly across habitats with gradients in resource availability. Many studies have found low predictive power, however, when linking trait measurements to species demographic rates. Seedlings face different challenges recruiting on the forest floor and may exhibit different traits and/or performance trade-offs than older individuals face in the eventual adult niche. Seed mass is the typical proxy for seedling success, but species also differ in cotyledon strategy (reserve vs. photosynthetic) or other leaf, stem and root traits. These can cause species with the same average seed mass to have divergent performance in the same habitat. We combined long-term studies of seedling dynamics with functional trait data collected at a standard life-history stage in three diverse neotropical forests to ask whether variation in coordinated suites of traits predicts variation among species in demographic performance. Across hundreds of species in Ecuador, Panama and Puerto Rico, we found seedlings displayed correlated suites of leaf, stem, and root traits, which strongly correlated with seed mass and cotyledon strategy. Variation among species in seedling functional traits, seed mass, and cotyledon strategy were strong predictors of trade-offs in seedling growth and survival. These results underscore the importance of matching the ontogenetic stage of the trait measurement to the stage of demographic dynamics. Our findings highlight the importance of cotyledon strategy in addition to seed mass as a key component of seed and seedling biology in tropical forests because of the contribution of carbon reserves in storage cotyledons to reducing mortality rates and explaining the growth-survival trade-off among species. Synthesis: With strikingly consistent patterns across three tropical forests, we find strong evidence for the promise of functional traits to provide mechanistic links between seedling form and demographic performance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Metz","given":"Margaret R."},{"family":"Wright","given":"S.

  {"id":"meyerCanopyAreaLarge2018","abstract":"Large tropical trees store signiﬁcant amounts of carbon in woody components and their distribution plays an important role in forest carbon stocks and dynamics. Here, we explore the properties of a new lidar-derived index, the large tree canopy area (LCA) deﬁned as the area occupied by canopy above a reference height. We hypothesize that this simple measure of forest structure representing the crown area of large canopy trees could consistently explain the landscape variations in forest volume and aboveground biomass (AGB) across a range of climate and edaphic conditions. To test this hypothesis, we assembled a unique dataset of high-resolution airborne light detection and ranging (lidar) and ground inventory data in nine undisturbed old-growth Neotropical forests, of which four had plots large enough (1 ha) to calibrate our model. We found that the LCA for trees greater than 27 m (∼ 25–30 m) in height and at least 100 m2 crown size in a unit area (1 ha), explains more than 75 % of total forest volume variations, irrespective of the forest biogeographic conditions. When weighted by average wood density of the stand, LCA can be used as an unbiased estimator of AGB across sites (R2 = 0.78, RMSE = 46.02 Mg ha−1, bias = −0.63 Mg ha−1). Unlike other lidar-derived metrics with complex nonlinear relations to biomass, the relationship between LCA and AGB is linear and remains unique across forest types. A comparison with tree inventories across the study sites indicates that LCA correlates best with the crown area (or basal area) of trees with diameter greater than 50 cm.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Meyer","given":"Victoria"},{"family":"Saatchi","given":"Sassan"},{"family":"Clark","given":"David B."},{"family":"Keller","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Vincent","given":"Grégoire"},{"family":"Ferraz","given":"António"},{"family":"Espírito-Santo","given":"Fernando"},{"family":"Oliveira","given":"Marcus V.

  {"id":"meyerCanopyHeightExplains2020","abstract":"Aim Tall and structurally complex forests can provide ample habitat and niche space for climbing plants, supporting high liana species richness. We test to what extent canopy height (as a proxy of 3-D habitat structure), climate and soil interact to determine species richness in the largest clade of Neotropical lianas. We expect that the effect of canopy height on species richness is higher for lianas from closed tropical rain forests compared to riparian and savanna habitats. Location Neotropics. Time period Present. Major taxa studied Tribe Bignonieae (Bignoniaceae). Methods We used structural equation models to evaluate direct and indirect effects of canopy height, climate (temperature, precipitation and precipitation seasonality), and soil (cation exchange capacity and soil types) on overall Bignonieae species richness (339 liana species), as well as on species richness of lianas from forest, riparian and savanna habitats, respectively. We further performed multiple regression models with Moran's eigenvector maps to account for spatial autocorrelation. Results Canopy height was a key driver of liana species richness, in addition to climate and soil. Species richness of forest lianas showed a strong positive relationship with canopy height whereas the relationship was less pronounced for riparian species. Richness of savanna species decreased with increasing canopy height. Climate also explained a substantial proportion of variation in liana species richness whereas soil variables showed little explanatory power. Main conclusions The relationship between canopy height and liana species richness differs among habitats. While forest and riparian lianas benefit from tall and complex habitats that provide physical support to reach the canopy to escape low light availability in the understorey, high light availability in open habitats and an increased risk of embolism of conductive vessels for lianas with long stems living in areas with high seasonality might explain the inverse relationship between species richness and canopy height in savannas.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Meyer","given":"Leila"},{"family":"Diniz-Filho","given":"José Alexandre F."},{"family":"Lohmann","given":"Lúcia G."},{"family":"Hortal","given":"Joaquín"},{"family":"Barreto","given":"Elisa"},{"family":"Rangel","given":"Thiago"},{"family":"Kissling","given":"W.

  {"id":"milenkovicAssessingAmazonRainforest2022","abstract":"Two novel satellite LiDAR missions —GEDI and ICESat-2— are currently operational and combined provide near-global measurements of forest height and structure. Such data underpin a new era of large-area approaches for measuring forest height in regrowing forests of different ages and assessing associated regrowth rates. Two LiDAR missions further allow for comparing independently derived forest heights and regrowth rates. This study utilized both GEDI and ICESat-2 measurements to assess regrowth rates in regrowing forests of different ages for the Brazilian state Rondônia. We considered 19 data subgroups stratified by beam strength, light condition, beam sensitivity, and waveform processing algorithm to assess the retrieval uncertainty and identify data subgroups associated with the most reliable regrowth estimates. The quality assessment of GEDI and ICESat-2 forest heights over four 50 km long airborne LiDAR strips determined a root mean square error of 4.14 m (CV = 17%) and 5.91 m (CV = 19%) and a mean error of 0.04 m and −2.81 m, respectively. A linear calibration model between satellite- and airborne-LiDAR heights was then derived for each data subgroup and used to calibrate satellite heights. Forest regrowth rates were subsequently estimated for each satellite mission using a space-for-time imputation with forest heights’ medians per stand age class. The total growth of GEDI and ICESat-2 median forest heights after 33 years was 20.17 m (SE = 1.3 m) and 20.13 m (SE = 2.8 m), respectively. However, when growth was approximated with different non-linear models, the total growth differed by up to 6%, and the average regrowth rate even by up to 23%. The study revealed that omitting either the calibration step or the removal of secondary-forest-border pixels would result in an underestimation of the regrowth rate by more than 20%. Furthermore, the ICESat-2 weak beams were found unreliable for regrowth retrieval. The study showed that the novel satellite LiDAR data and the proposed methods could assess median forest height growth over large areas. However, forest age errors should also be accounted for in the retrieval uncertainty before comparing the growth estimates across different regions.

  {"id":"mirzabaevEconomicsEcosystemRestoration2023","abstract":"Restoration of degraded ecosystems is essential for having a stable climate, reducing weather extremes and disease burden, producing enough food to feed growing populations, and generally keeping the world livable. However, we are currently rapidly degrading ecosystems worldwide, thus destroying the very basis of life. There is a major gap between what investments are needed to restore degraded ecosystems and prevent further degradation and what is actually being invested. In addition, most governments are still learning how to design and implement ecosystem restoration policies that are effective and efficient.

Remote sensing (\n                RS\n                ) is currently the key tool for this purpose, but\n                RS\n                does not estimate vegetation biomass directly, and thus may miss significant spatial variations in forest structure.

Carbon‐mapping techniques must be revised to account for the known ecological variation in tree wood density and allometry to create maps suitable for carbon accounting. The use of single relationships between tree canopy height and above‐ground biomass inevitably yields large, spatially correlated errors. This presents a significant challenge to both the forest conservation and remote sensing communities, because neither wood density nor species assemblages can be reliably mapped from space.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Mitchard","given":"Edward T.

  {"id":"mooreTheoryDemographicOptimality2023","abstract":"Carbon uptake by the land is a key determinant of future climate change. Unfortunately, Dynamic Global Vegetation Models have many unknown internal parameters which leads to significant uncertainty in projections of the future land carbon sink. By contrast, observed forest inventories in both Amazonia and the USA show strikingly common tree-size distributions, pointing to a simpler modelling paradigm. The curvature of these size-distributions is related to the ratio of mortality to growth in Demographic Equilibrium Theory (DET). We extend DET to include recruitment limited by competitive exclusion from existing trees. From this, we find simultaneous maxima of tree density and biomass in terms of respectively the ratio of mortality to growth and the proportion of primary productivity allocated to reproduction, an idea we call Demographic Optimality (DO). Combining DO with the ratio of mortality to growth common to the US and Amazon forests, results in the prediction that about an eighth of productivity should be allocated to reproduction, which is broadly consistent with observations. Another prediction of the model is that seed mortality should decrease with increasing seed size, such that the advantage of having many small seeds is nullified by the higher seed mortality. Demographic Optimality is therefore consistent with the common shape of tree-size distributions seen in very different forests, and an allocation to reproduction that is independent of seed size.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Moore","given":"Jon"},{"family":"Argles","given":"Arthur"},{"family":"Cox","given":"Peter"}],"citation-key":"mooreTheoryDemographicOptimality2023","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-023-44860-7","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,31]]},"language":"en","license":"2023 Crown","number":"1","page":"18712","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"A theory of demographic optimality in forests","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-44860-7","volume":"13"},
  {"id":"moraTestingChronosequencesDynamic2015","abstract":"Chronosequences, commonly used to assess succession, have been questioned because of their failure to project successional trajectories. Here, we develop a simple analytical approach combining both chronosequence and dynamic data to test the power of age of abandonment and site factors to explain and predict succession. The approach proceeds by ﬁrst ﬁtting statistical models relating age to attribute values (the chronosequence model) and their observed changes (the dynamic model) to test explanatory power. Predictive power is then tested by bootstrapping the chronosequence model to derive conﬁdence intervals for expected changes and comparing them with the dynamic model. Finally, residuals from both models are tested against site factors. The procedure was applied to six attributes (basal area, plant density, mean plant height, species richness, evenness, and composition) of the woody community (plants >1 cm dbh within 0.1-ha plots) in nine abandoned cattle pastures (0–12 yr) and three old growth tropical dry forests monitored over 6 yr. Age explained 60–97 percent of the variance in community attributes and only 32–57 percent in observed changes. It signiﬁcantly overestimated basal area and mean height, while species richness and composition were highly predicted. Besides age, management history also explained successional dynamics. Our results suggest age is not necessarily a reliable predictor of short-term successional dynamics, and explanatory power is not indicative of predictive power. Because of this low reliability, caution is needed when applying chronosequences to evaluate ecosystem services’ recovery. The analytical approach developed here contributes to a better exploration of those possible limitations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Mora","given":"Francisco"},{"family":"Martínez-Ramos","given":"Miguel"},{"family":"Ibarra-Manríquez","given":"Guillermo"},{"family":"Pérez-Jiménez","given":"Alfredo"},{"family":"Trilleras","given":"Jenny"},{"family":"Balvanera","given":"Patricia"}],"citation-key":"moraTestingChronosequencesDynamic2015","container-title":"Biotropica","container-title-short":"Biotropica","DOI":"10.1111/btp.12187","ISSN":"00063606","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",1]]},"language":"en","page":"38-48","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Testing Chronosequences through Dynamic Approaches: Time and Site Effects on Tropical Dry Forest Succession","title-short":"Testing Chronosequences through Dynamic Approaches","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/btp.12187","volume":"47"},
  {"id":"mouquetREVIEWPredictiveEcology2015","abstract":"In a rapidly changing world, ecology has the potential to move from empirical and conceptual stages to application and management issues. It is now possible to make large-scale predictions up to continental or global scales, ranging from the future distribution of biological diversity to changes in ecosystem functioning and services. With these recent developments, ecology has a historical opportunity to become a major actor in the development of a sustainable human society. With this opportunity, however, also comes an important responsibility in developing appropriate predictive models, correctly interpreting their outcomes and communicating their limitations. There is also a danger that predictions grow faster than our understanding of ecological systems, resulting in a gap between the scientists generating the predictions and stakeholders using them (conservation biologists, environmental managers, journalists, policymakers). Here, we use the context provided by the current surge of ecological predictions on the future of biodiversity to clarify what prediction means, and to pinpoint the challenges that should be addressed in order to improve predictive ecological models and the way they are understood and used.

  {"id":"mouraExtensiveReefSystem2016","abstract":"Large rivers create major gaps in reef distribution along tropical shelves. The Amazon River represents 20% of the global riverine discharge to the ocean, generating up to a 1.3 × 106–km2 plume, and extensive muddy bottoms in the equatorial margin of South America. As a result, a wide area of the tropical North Atlantic is heavily affected in terms of salinity, pH, light penetration, and sedimentation. Such unfavorable conditions were thought to imprint a major gap in Western Atlantic reefs. We present an extensive carbonate system off the Amazon mouth, underneath the river plume. Significant carbonate sedimentation occurred during lowstand sea level, and still occurs in the outer shelf, resulting in complex hard-bottom topography. A permanent near-bottom wedge of ocean water, together with the seasonal nature of the plume’s eastward retroflection, conditions the existence of this extensive (~9500 km2) hard-bottom mosaic. The Amazon reefs transition from accretive to erosional structures and encompass extensive rhodolith beds. Carbonate structures function as a connectivity corridor for wide depth–ranging reef-associated species, being heavily colonized by large sponges and other structure-forming filter feeders that dwell under low light and high levels of particulates. The oxycline between the plume and subplume is associated with chemoautotrophic and anaerobic microbial metabolisms. The system described here provides several insights about the responses of tropical reefs to suboptimal and marginal reef-building conditions, which are accelerating worldwide due to global changes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Moura","given":"Rodrigo L."},{"family":"Amado-Filho","given":"Gilberto M."},{"family":"Moraes","given":"Fernando C."},{"family":"Brasileiro","given":"Poliana S."},{"family":"Salomon","given":"Paulo S."},{"family":"Mahiques","given":"Michel M."},{"family":"Bastos","given":"Alex C."},{"family":"Almeida","given":"Marcelo G."},{"family":"Silva","given":"Jomar M."},{"family":"Araujo","given":"Beatriz F."},{"family":"Brito","given":"Frederico P."},{"family":"Rangel","given":"Thiago P."},{"family":"Oliveira","given":"Braulio C.

  {"id":"mudeleModelingDengueVector2021","abstract":"Mosquitoes propagate many human diseases, some widespread and with no vaccines. The Ae. aegypti mosquito vector transmits Zika, Chikungunya, and Dengue viruses. Effective public health interventions to control the spread of these diseases and protect the population require models that explain the core environmental drivers of the vector population. Field campaigns are expensive, and data from meteorological sites that feed models with the required environmental data often lack detail. As a consequence, we explore temporal modeling of the population of Ae. aegypti mosquito vector species and environmental conditions– temperature, moisture, pre­ cipitation, and vegetation– have been shown to have significant effects. We use earth observation (EO) data as our source for estimating these biotic and abiotic environmental variables based on proxy features, namely: Normalized difference vegetation index, Normalized difference water index, Precipitation, and Land surface temperature. We obtained our response variable from field-collected mosquito population measured weekly using 791 mosquito traps in Vila Velha city, Brazil, for 36 weeks in 2017, and 40 weeks in 2018. Recent similar studies have used machine learning (ML) techniques for this task. However, these techniques are neither intuitive nor explainable from an operational point of view. As a result, we use a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) to model this relationship due to its fitness for count response variable modeling, its interpretability, and the ability to visualize the confidence intervals for all inferences.

  {"id":"mullissaDeepLearningAutomatic2023","abstract":"The advent of temporally dense radar data such as the Sentinel-1 SAR have opened the door for rapid forest disturbance detection in the humid tropics. Tropical dry forest disturbance detection, however, were challenged by seasonality and more open canopy characteristics. In this manuscript, we proposed a Sentinel-1 SAR and deep learning based rapid forest disturbance detection approach for tropical dry forests. We demonstrated a weakly supervised method for reference label harvesting based on medium resolution globally available forest and forest disturbance maps. We trained a deep neural network model to derive forest and forest disturbance probabilities from Sentinel-1 images in the first step. We then implemented a probabilistic disturbance detection and refinement method to map forest disturbances in near real-time in two test regions in Paraguay and Mozambique. We mapped new forest disturbances in an emulated near real-time scenario for 2020 and 2021 and evaluated the spatial accuracy of the disturbance alerts by generating area adjusted precision, recall and F-1 score. We also evaluated the improvement in timeliness of disturbance detection by estimating mean time difference of disturbance events detection with that of Landsat-based GLAD alerts. The generated alerts in Paraguay and Mozambique achieved a precision, recall and F-1 score of 0.99, 0.61, 0.75 and 0.97, 0.51, 0.66, respectively. The proposed method detected disturbances with a mean of 21 days (± 18 days) earlier in Paraguay and 18 days (± 18 days) earlier in Mozambique than the Landsat-based GLAD alerts. These results demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed method and its viability to be used in an operational setting to generate large area rapid near real-time disturbance alerts in the dry tropics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Mullissa","given":"Adugna"},{"family":"Reiche","given":"Johannes"},{"family":"Herold","given":"Martin"}],"citation-key":"mullissaDeepLearningAutomatic2023","container-title":"Remote Sensing of Environment","container-title-short":"Remote Sensing of Environment","DOI":"10.1016/j.rse.2023.113799","ISSN":"0034-4257","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,1]]},"page":"113799","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Deep learning and automatic reference label harvesting for Sentinel-1 SAR-based rapid tropical dry forest disturbance mapping","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425723003504","volume":"298"},

  {"id":"nagyNutrientLimitationTropical2017","abstract":"Secondary forests now make up more than one-h­ alf of all tropical forests, and constraints on their biomass accumulation will influence the strength of the terrestrial carbon (C) sink in the coming decades. However the variance in secondary tropical forest biomass for a given stand age and climate is high and our understanding of why is limited. We constructed a model of terrestrial C, nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) cycling to examine the influence of disturbance and management practices on nutrient limitation and biomass recovery in secondary tropical forests. The model predicted that N limited the rate of forest recovery in the first few decades following harvest, but that this limitation switched to P approximately 30–40 yr after abandonment, consistent with field data on N and P cycling from secondary tropical f­orest chronosequences. Simulated biomass recovery agreed well with field data of biomass accumulation following harvest (R2 = 0.80). Model results showed that if all biomass remained on site following a severe disturbance such as blowdown, regrowth approached pre-d­isturbance ­biomass in 80–90 yr, and recovery was faster following smaller disturbances such as selective logging. Field data from regrowth on abandoned pastures were consistent with simulated losses of nutrients in soil organic matter, particularly P. Following any forest disturbance that ­involved the removal of nutrients (i.e., except blowdown), forest regrowth produced reduced biomass relative to the initial state as a result of nutrient loss through harvest, leaching and/or sequestration by secondary minerals. Differences in nutrient availability accounted for 49–94% of the variance in secondary forest biomass C at a given stand age. Management lessons from this study are the importance of strategies that help retain nutrients on site, recognizing the role of coarse woody debris in immobilization and subsequent release of nutrients, and the potential for nutrient additions to enhance biomass growth and recovery in secondary tropical forests.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Nagy","given":"R.

However, given the diversity of tree species and forest biomes, quantifying the multitude of demographic strategies within and across forests and the way that they translate into forest structure and function remains a significant challenge. Here, we quantify the demographic rates of 1961 tree species from temperate and tropical forests and evaluate how demographic diversity (DD) and demographic composition (DC) differ across forests, and how these differences in demography relate to species richness, aboveground biomass (AGB), and carbon residence time. We find wide variation in DD and DC across forest plots, patterns that are not explained by species richness or climate variables alone. There is no evidence that DD has an effect on either AGB or carbon residence time. Rather, the DC of forests, specifically the relative abundance of large statured species, predicted both biomass and carbon residence time. Our results demonstrate the distinct DCs of globally distributed forests, reflecting biogeography, recent history, and current plot conditions. Linking the DC of forests to resilience or vulnerability to climate change, will improve the precision and accuracy of predictions of future forest composition, structure, and function.","archive_location":"35080088","author":[{"family":"Needham","given":"J.

We examined changes to soil bulk density and C and N stocks in seven chronosequences, each consisting of an intact forest and pastures of different ages created directly from cleared forest (7 forests, 18 pastures), along a 700-km transect in Rondônia in the southwestern Amazon Basin. The transect included sites with a similar climate but a range of soil types. We used soil δ13C distributions to determine the origin of soil C and to infer changes to soil C cycling patterns after forest clearing. Soil bulk density increased under pasture; these increases were significant in 6 of 18 pastures examined. Changes in C stocks to a depth of 30 cm under pasture ranged from a loss of 0.72 kg/m2 to an increase of 1.77 kg/m2. Soil C stocks increased in 14 of 18 pastures, but these increases were significant in only 4 pastures. Changes in soil N stocks to a depth of 30 cm ranged from a loss of 0.25 kg/m2 to a gain of 0.23 kg/m2 and showed a similar pattern to C, except in one site where we measured significant N loss. Five of 18 pastures accumulated significant amounts of N, and one pasture lost a significant amount of N. Soil δ13C values were greater in pastures than in the original forests, and δ13C values increased with a longer time under C4 pasture vegetation. Bulk density increases were greater on soils with higher clay contents. Carbon accumulation increased with pasture age but was independent of soil texture. Soil C increases to a depth of 30 cm of up to 1.77 kg/m2 amounted to an increase of >50% of the original soil C stock and represented up to 12% of the C in the biomass of forest vegetation. In contrast, changes to soil N stocks in the range of 0.25 kg/m2 approximately equaled the N stock in the original forest vegetation. Our results indicated that when site history was controlled by considering only pastures formed directly from cleared forest, C and N accumulation was the dominant trend in pasture soils. Absence of a correlation between C and N accumulation and soil texture suggested that site history and management may be more important than soil type as determinants of the direction and magnitude of changes in soil C and N stocks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Neill","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Melillo","given":"Jerry M."},{"family":"Steudler","given":"Paul A."},{"family":"Cerri","given":"Carlos C."},{"family":"Moraes","given":"Jener F.

There is increasing consensus about the importance of incorporating these “ecosystem services” into resource management decisions, but quantifying the levels and values of these services has proven difficult. We use a spatially explicit modeling tool, Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST), to predict changes in ecosystem services, biodiversity conservation, and commodity production levels. We apply InVEST to stakeholder-defined scenarios of land-use/land-cover change in the Willamette Basin, Oregon. We found that scenarios that received high scores for a variety of ecosystem services also had high scores for biodiversity, suggesting there is little tradeoff between biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services. Scenarios involving more development had higher commodity production values, but lower levels of biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services. However, including payments for carbon sequestration alleviates this tradeoff. Quantifying ecosystem services in a spatially explicit manner, and analyzing tradeoffs between them, can help to make natural resource decisions more effective, efficient, and defensible.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Nelson","given":"Erik"},{"family":"Mendoza","given":"Guillermo"},{"family":"Regetz","given":"James"},{"family":"Polasky","given":"Stephen"},{"family":"Tallis","given":"Heather"},{"family":"Cameron","given":"DRichard"},{"family":"Chan","given":"Kai MA"},{"family":"Daily","given":"Gretchen C"},{"family":"Goldstein","given":"Joshua"},{"family":"Kareiva","given":"Peter M"},{"family":"Lonsdorf","given":"Eric"},{"family":"Naidoo","given":"Robin"},{"family":"Ricketts","given":"Taylor H"},{"family":"Shaw","given":"MRebecca"}],"citation-key":"nelsonModelingMultipleEcosystem2009","container-title":"Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment","DOI":"10.1890/080023","ISSN":"1540-9309","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009"]]},"language":"en","license":"© The Ecological Society of America","page":"4-11","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Modeling multiple ecosystem services, biodiversity conservation, commodity production, and tradeoffs at landscape scales","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/080023","volume":"7"},
  {"id":"nepstadInhibitionAmazonDeforestation2006","abstract":"Abstract: Conservation scientists generally agree that many types of protected areas will be needed to protect tropical forests. But little is known of the comparative performance of inhabited and uninhabited reserves in slowing the most extreme form of forest disturbance: conversion to agriculture. We used satellite-based maps of land cover and fire occurrence in the Brazilian Amazon to compare the performance of large (>10,000 ha) uninhabited (parks) and inhabited (indigenous lands, extractive reserves, and national forests) reserves. Reserves significantly reduced both deforestation and fire. Deforestation was 1.7 (extractive reserves) to 20 (parks) times higher along the outside versus the inside of the reserve perimeters and fire occurrence was 4 (indigenous lands) to 9 (national forests) times higher. No strong difference in the inhibition of deforestation (p= 0.11) or fire (p= 0.34) was found between parks and indigenous lands. However, uninhabited reserves tended to be located away from areas of high deforestation and burning rates. In contrast, indigenous lands were often created in response to frontier expansion, and many prevented deforestation completely despite high rates of deforestation along their boundaries. The inhibitory effect of indigenous lands on deforestation was strong after centuries of contact with the national society and was not correlated with indigenous population density. Indigenous lands occupy one-fifth of the Brazilian Amazon—five times the area under protection in parks—and are currently the most important barrier to Amazon deforestation. As the protected-area network expands from 36% to 41% of the Brazilian Amazon over the coming years, the greatest challenge will be successful reserve implementation in high-risk areas of frontier expansion as indigenous lands are strengthened. This success will depend on a broad base of political support.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Nepstad","given":"D."},{"family":"Schwartzman","given":"S."},{"family":"Bamberger","given":"B."},{"family":"Santilli","given":"M."},{"family":"Ray","given":"D."},{"family":"Schlesinger","given":"P."},{"family":"Lefebvre","given":"P."},{"family":"Alencar","given":"A."},{"family":"Prinz","given":"E."},{"family":"Fiske","given":"Greg"},{"family":"Rolla","given":"Alicia"}],"citation-key":"nepstadInhibitionAmazonDeforestation2006","container-title":"Conservation Biology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00351.x","ISSN":"1523-1739","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006"]]},"language":"en","page":"65-73","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Inhibition of Amazon Deforestation and Fire by Parks and Indigenous Lands","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00351.x","volume":"20"},

Can greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from land-use, more than one-fourth of the global total, decline as growth in land-based production accelerates? This review examines the status of two major international initiatives that are designed to address different aspects of this challenge. REDD+ is an emerging policy framework for providing incentives to tropical nations and states that reduce their GHG emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. Market transformation, best represented by agricultural commodity roundtables, seeks to exclude unsustainable farmers from commodity markets through international social and environmental standards for farmers and processors. These global initiatives could potentially become synergistically integrated through (i) a shared approach for measuring and favouring high environmental and social performance of land use across entire jurisdictions and (ii) stronger links with the domestic policies, finance and laws in the jurisdictions where agricultural expansion is moving into forests. To achieve scale, the principles of REDD+ and sustainable farming systems must be embedded in domestic low-emission rural development models capable of garnering support across multiple constituencies. We illustrate this potential with the case of Mato Grosso State in the Brazilian Amazon.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Nepstad","given":"Daniel C."},{"family":"Boyd","given":"William"},{"family":"Stickler","given":"Claudia M."},{"family":"Bezerra","given":"Tathiana"},{"family":"Azevedo","given":"Andrea A."}],"citation-key":"nepstadRespondingClimateChange2013","container-title":"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","DOI":"10.1098/rstb.2012.0167","issue":"1619","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",6,5]]},"page":"20120167","publisher":"Royal Society","source":"royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","title":"Responding to climate change and the global land crisis: REDD+, market transformation and low-emissions rural development","title-short":"Responding to climate change and the global land crisis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rstb.2012.0167","volume":"368"},

  {"id":"neumann-coselSoilCarbonDynamics2011","abstract":"Secondary forests are gaining increased importance in tropical landscapes and have recently been reported to act as potential belowground carbon sinks. While economic interest in the management of secondary forests to mitigate carbon emissions is rising, the dynamics of soil carbon stocks under these ecosystems remain poorly understood. Recent studies report conflicting results concerning soil carbon trends as well as multiple confounding factors (e.g. soil type, topography and land-use history) affecting these trends. In this study, organic carbon stocks were measured in the mineral soil up to 20cm depth of at 24 active pastures, 5–8-year-old, and 12–15-year-old secondary forest sites on former pastures. Additionally, we estimated carbon stocks under a 100-year-old secondary forest and compared them to those of nearby mature forests. Abiotic conditions in the study area were homogenous, enabling us to isolate the effect of land-use change on soil organic carbon stocks. Contrary to our expectations, soil carbon stocks in the top 10cm did not change with young secondary forest development. Pasture soils stored 24.8±2.9Mgha−1 carbon (mean±standard error) in the top 10cm, and no accumulation of soil carbon was apparent during the first 15 years of secondary succession. Soil carbon stocks under 100-year-old secondary forests, averaging 43.0±7.9Mgha−1 (mean±standard error), were clearly higher than those recorded at younger sites and approached levels of soil carbon stocks under mature forests. These data indicate that soil carbon stocks in this region of Panama are not affected by the land-use transition from pasture to young secondary regrowth. However, an increase of soil carbon storage might be possible over a longer period of time. Our results support trends observed in other tropical areas and highlight the importance of environmental conditions such as soil properties rather than land-use transitions on soil carbon dynamics. While our understanding of organic carbon dynamics in tropical soils remains limited, these results underscore the challenges of undertaking short-term reforestation projects with the expectation of increasing soil carbon sequestration.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Neumann-Cosel","given":"Luisa"},{"family":"Zimmermann","given":"Beate"},{"family":"Hall","given":"Jefferson S."},{"family":"Breugel","given":"Michiel","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Elsenbeer","given":"Helmut"}],"citation-key":"neumann-coselSoilCarbonDynamics2011","collection-title":"The Ecology and Ecosystem Services of Native Trees: Implications for Reforestation and Land Restoration in Mesoamerica","container-title":"Forest Ecology and Management","container-title-short":"Forest Ecology and Management","DOI":"10.1016/j.foreco.2010.07.023","ISSN":"0378-1127","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",5,15]]},"page":"1625-1633","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Soil carbon dynamics under young tropical secondary forests on former pastures—A case study from Panama","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037811271000407X","volume":"261"},

SFs account for swathes of tropical forest landscapes that have lost their capacity to provide a high level of goods and services. They are also located in highly dynamic and human-pressured landscapes and are vulnerable to natural and human-induced catastrophic events, such as hurricanes or fires. Without appropriate silvicultural management to increase their economic value and restore their ecological functions, they often become degraded and are sometimes cleared for more short-term economically productive activities. Given the increasing demand for tropical timber in recent decades that will continue in the near future, we suggest that active restoration geared towards wood production is an opportunity for SF conservation. Promoting sustainable wood production -i.e. associated with other environmental services- in these disturbed forest ecosystems is also a way to reduce logging pressure on the remaining intact primary tropical forests, indeed, this may be the most important reason to enhance active restoration aimed at wood production in tropical SFs worldwide.

Climate change poses additional risks to the stability of the forests. Studies suggest “tipping points” not to be transgressed: 4° C of global warming or 40% of total deforested area. The regional development debate has focused on attempting to reconcile maximizing conservation with intensification of traditional agriculture. Large reductions of deforestation in the last decade open up opportunities for an alternative model based on seeing the Amazon as a global public good of biological assets for the creation of high-value products and ecosystem services. \n          ,  \n            For half a century, the process of economic integration of the Amazon has been based on intensive use of renewable and nonrenewable natural resources, which has brought significant basin-wide environmental alterations. The rural development in the Amazonia pushed the agricultural frontier swiftly, resulting in widespread land-cover change, but agriculture in the Amazon has been of low productivity and unsustainable. The loss of biodiversity and continued deforestation will lead to high risks of irreversible change of its tropical forests. It has been established by modeling studies that the Amazon may have two “tipping points,” namely, temperature increase of 4 °C or deforestation exceeding 40% of the forest area. If transgressed, large-scale “savannization” of mostly southern and eastern Amazon may take place. The region has warmed about 1 °C over the last 60 y, and total deforestation is reaching 20% of the forested area. The recent significant reductions in deforestation—80% reduction in the Brazilian Amazon in the last decade—opens up opportunities for a novel sustainable development paradigm for the future of the Amazon.

Such patterns were observed over time within sites and across successional stages. Floristic reassembly in secondary forests showed a clear convergence with mature forest community composition, supporting an equilibrium model.

We showed that the trajectories of these forest attributes were poorly predicted by stand age and varied significantly within and among sites. Our models reproduced the general successional trends observed, but high levels of noise were needed to increase model predictability.

Here, we provide the first attempt, to our knowledge, to quantify predictability and uncertainty during succession based on the most extensive long-term datasets ever assembled for Neotropical forests. We develop a novel approach that integrates deterministic and stochastic components into different candidate models describing the dynamical interactions among three widely used and interrelated forest attributes—stem density, basal area, and species density. Within each of the seven study sites, successional trajectories were highly idiosyncratic, even when controlling for prior land use, environment, and initial conditions in these attributes. Plot factors were far more important than stand age in explaining successional trajectories. For each site, the best-fit model was able to capture the complete set of time series in certain attributes only when both the deterministic and stochastic components were set to similar magnitudes. Surprisingly, predictability of stem density, basal area, and species density did not show consistent trends across attributes, study sites, or land use history, and was independent of plot size and time series length. The model developed here represents the best approach, to date, for characterizing autogenic successional dynamics and demonstrates the low predictability of successional trajectories. These high levels of uncertainty suggest that the impacts of allogenic factors on rates of change during tropical forest succession are far more pervasive than previously thought, challenging the way ecologists view and investigate forest regeneration.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Norden","given":"Natalia"},{"family":"Angarita","given":"Héctor A."},{"family":"Bongers","given":"Frans"},{"family":"Martínez-Ramos","given":"Miguel"},{"family":"Granzow-de La Cerda","given":"Iñigo"},{"family":"Van Breugel","given":"Michiel"},{"family":"Lebrija-Trejos","given":"Edwin"},{"family":"Meave","given":"Jorge A."},{"family":"Vandermeer","given":"John"},{"family":"Williamson","given":"G.

  {"id":"nowakEvolutionaryDynamicsStructured2010","abstract":"Evolutionary dynamics shape the living world around us. At the centre of every evolutionary process is a population of reproducing individuals. The structure of that population affects evolutionary dynamics. The individuals can be molecules, cells, viruses, multicellular organisms or humans. Whenever the fitness of individuals depends on the relative abundance of phenotypes in the population, we are in the realm of evolutionary game theory. Evolutionary game theory is a general approach that can describe the competition of species in an ecosystem, the interaction between hosts and parasites, between viruses and cells, and also the spread of ideas and behaviours in the human population. In this perspective, we review the recent advances in evolutionary game dynamics with a particular emphasis on stochastic approaches in finite sized and structured populations. We give simple, fundamental laws that determine how natural selection chooses between competing strategies. We study the well-mixed population, evolutionary graph theory, games in phenotype space and evolutionary set theory. We apply these results to the evolution of cooperation. The mechanism that leads to the evolution of cooperation in these settings could be called ‘spatial selection’: cooperators prevail against defectors by clustering in physical or other spaces.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Nowak","given":"Martin A."},{"family":"Tarnita","given":"Corina E."},{"family":"Antal","given":"Tibor"}],"citation-key":"nowakEvolutionaryDynamicsStructured2010","container-title":"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","DOI":"10.1098/rstb.2009.0215","issue":"1537","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",1,12]]},"page":"19-30","publisher":"Royal Society","source":"royalsocietypublishing-org.proxy3.library.mcgill.ca (Atypon)","title":"Evolutionary dynamics in structured populations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rstb.2009.0215","volume":"365"},

This means that some individuals sacrifice their own reproductive potential in order to raise the offspring of others, a fact that Darwin recognized as a challenge to evolutionary theory.

In an Analysis feature, Martin Nowak, Corina Tarnita and Edward O. Wilson point out that this approach has its limitations.

  {"id":"nunesChallengesOpportunitiesLargescale2020","abstract":"Reforestation and forest restoration are recognized as an effective means of halting biodiversity loss and increasing the performance of ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration and the protection and maintenance of water resources. The objective of this review is to describe the main challenges and opportunities for large-scale forest restoration and reforestation using native species in the Amazon, focusing on Pará state and the Itacaiúnas watershed. Large-scale forest restoration and reforestation in the Eastern Amazon may contribute to meeting national and global restoration commitments and reducing/eliminating the actual forest deficit caused by noncompliance with the Brazilian Native Vegetation Protection Law, concomitantly mitigating impacts on climate change, enhancing ecosystem services (e.g., protection of water resources and reduction of soil erosion) and maintaining biodiversity. The selection of active and passive reforestation approaches depends on land-use history, landscape context and reforestation targets, and the promotion of natural regeneration reduces implementation costs. To measure the ecological and socioeconomic success of forest restoration and reforestation, a large number of on-the-ground and remote indicators are available, and the use of a combination of both methods can reduce the monitoring cost. The socioeconomic benefits of reforestation include financial gains from restoration and carbon programs; furthermore, the commercialization of timber and non-timber products and their use for subsistence may improve livelihoods and farm incomes. Nevertheless, implementation of large-scale reforestation in the Eastern Amazon requires research regarding the selection and the nutritional demands of native species and the development of adequate soil management strategies that promote the growth of native species and yields. The insufficient availability of seeds and seedlings is a major bottleneck for large-scale forest restoration and reforestation with native species. Thus, increasing the availability, diversity and quality of seedlings and seeds of native species to supply the demand for planting activities, as well as the registration of producers in the National Register of Seeds and Seedlings, is necessary to achieve compliance with national legislation and international commitments. Competition between reforestation and the expansion of agricultural and cattle ranching frontiers combined with a lack of markets for commercial products from restored areas constrains the socioeconomic viability of large-scale reforestation. To outweigh deforestation incentives, regulation and effective implementation of markets and programs such as REDD+, CDM and PES is thus paramount. To enhance the integration of human well-being, socioeconomic enhancements and ecological functionality, forest and landscape restoration concepts offer promising tools for the region.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Nunes","given":"Sâmia"},{"family":"Gastauer","given":"Markus"},{"family":"Cavalcante","given":"Rosane B.

Neste trabalho, usamos levantamentos usando um LiDAR terrestre a cada duas semanas durante estações chuvosas e secas na Amazônia Central. Mostramos que a fenologia das plantas varia entre os estratos verticais em florestas maduras, mas é sensível a distúrbios causados pela fragmentação florestal. Em combinação com medidas de microclima no sub-bosque da floresta, descobrimos que quando as temperaturas máximas diárias atingiram 35 °C no final da estação seca, o dossel superior de árvores altas em florestas não perturbadas perde folhas e galhos. Em contraste, o sub-bosque ganha folhas com o aumento da disponibilidade de luz que é provavelmente impulsionado pela perda do dossel e aumento da radiação solar durante esse período, mesmo com os solos e condições atmosféricas mais secos. No entanto, temperaturas persistentemente mais altas nas bordas da floresta exacerbaram as perdas de folhas e galhos de árvores de grande porte durante toda a estação seca, enquanto o sub-bosque nesses ambientes ricos em luz foi menos dependente da estrutura do dossel.

Based on a dataset of law enforcement indicators, we discuss how these changes explain recent Amazon deforestation dynamics. Our analysis also covers changes in the legal prosecution process and documents a militarization of enforcement between 2018 and 2022. From 2004 to 2018, 43.6 thousand land-use embargoes and 84.3 thousand fines were issued, targeting 3.3 million ha of land, and totaling USD 9.3 billion in penalties. Nevertheless, enforcement relaxed and became spatially more limited, signaling an increasing lack of commitment by the State to enforcing the law. The number of embargoes and asset confiscations dropped by 59% and 55% in 2019 and 2020, respectively. These changes were accompanied by a marked increase in enforcement expenditure, suggesting a massive efficiency loss. More importantly, the creation of so-called conciliation hearings and the centralization of legal processes in 2019 reduced the number of actual judgments and fines collected by 85% and decreased the ratio between lawsuits resulting in paid fines over filed ones from 17 to 5%.

Across all LULCTs, biodiversity was the most affected ecosystem component, followed by carbon stocks, but the magnitude of change differed widely among LULCTs and individual variables. Forest clearance for pasture was the most prevalent and high-impact transition, but we also identified other LULCTs with high impact but lower prevalence (e.g., forest to agriculture).

Vulnerability to xylem embolism (P50) is a key trait that indicates how species cope with drought and might explain plant distribution patterns across environmental gradients. Here we address its role on species sorting along a hydro-topographical gradient in a central Amazonian rainforest and examine its variance at the community scale. We measured P50 for 28 tree species, soil properties and estimated the hydrological niche of each species using an indicator of distance to the water table (HAND). We found a large hydraulic diversity, covering as much as 44% of the global angiosperm variation in P50. We show that P50: contributes to species segregation across a hydro-topographic gradient in the Amazon, and thus to species coexistence; is the result of repeated evolutionary adaptation within closely related taxa; is associated with species tolerance to P-poor soils, suggesting the evolution of a stress-tolerance syndrome to nutrients and drought; and is higher for trees in the valleys than uplands. The large observed hydraulic diversity and its association with topography has important implications for modelling and predicting forest and species resilience to climate change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Oliveira","given":"Rafael S."},{"family":"Costa","given":"Flavia R.

For Brazilian agribusiness, there has been an opportunity to increase exports, particularly in soybean production, in recent years, and therefore, soybean production has been expanding more and more across the states of the Brazilian Amazon. Soybean is the most important grain crop among temporary crops in the Brazilian Amazon; in 2019, it reached a value of USD 21.78 billion, using a planted area of 124,947 km2 (about 55% of the planted area). At the same time, overall deforestation increased signiﬁcantly in recent years: 10,897 km2 in 2019 and 9811 km2 in 2020. To study these changes, economic, social, and environmental sustainability indicators were identiﬁed and analyzed using a regression model, and changes in the main economic and socio-environmental indicators were observed that identiﬁed a strong positive correlation between agricultural GHG emissions and soybean-planted area. The impact on the local population was also analyzed between the years 2000 and 2019, and there was a mismatch between the population growth rate and the growth rate of the harvested area, which resulted in the displacement of the populations to the cities, and identiﬁed a strong positive correlation between the unemployment rate for young people and the soybean-planted area.

In this paper we review and synthesize the global effects of Amazon deforestation in Brazil, as well as drivers and challenges related to this process. To this end, we provide data on carbon emissions from combined annual maps of clear cutting of primary forests and spatial information on biomass distribution for different vegetation types and secondary vegetation growth, as well as the temporal dynamic related to the deforestation process and its interregional heterogeneity, the social and institutional drivers. In 2009, during the Conference of Parties, of the United Nation Framework Convention on Climate Change (Copenhagen, Denmark), Brazil announced a voluntary commitment to reduce the national GHG emissions by 2020 and, to this end, such commitment requires reducing Amazon rainforest deforestation by 80% over a decade.

  {"id":"omettoAmazonForestBiomass2014","abstract":"As land use change (LUC), including deforestation, is a patchy process, estimating the impact of LUC on carbon emissions requires spatially accurate underlying data on biomass distribution and change. The methods currently adopted to estimate the spatial variation of above- and below-ground biomass in tropical forests, in particular the Brazilian Amazon, are usually based on remote sensing analyses coupled with field datasets, which tend to be relatively scarce and often limited in their spatial distribution. There are notable differences among the resulting biomass maps found in the literature. These differences subsequently result in relatively high uncertainties in the carbon emissions calculated from land use change, and have a larger impact when biomass maps are coded into biomass classes referring to specific ranges of biomass values. In this paper we analyze the differences among recently-published biomass maps of the Amazon region, including the official information used by the Brazilian government for its communication to the United Nation Framework on Climate Change Convention of the United Nations. The estimated average pre-deforestation biomass in the four maps, for the areas of the Amazon region that had been deforested during the 1990-2009 period, varied from 205 +/- 32 Mg ha(-1) during 1990-1999, to 216 +/- 31 Mg ha(-1) during 2000-2009. The biomass values of the deforested areas in 2011 were between 7 and 24 % higher than for the average deforested areas during 1990-1999, suggesting that although there was variation in the mean value, deforestation was tending to occur in increasingly carbon-dense areas, with consequences for carbon emissions. To summarize, our key findings were: (i) the current maps of Amazonian biomass show substantial variation in both total biomass and its spatial distribution; (ii) carbon emissions estimates from deforestation are highly dependent on the spatial distribution of biomass as determined by any single biomass map, and on the deforestation process itself; (iii) future deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon is likely to affect forests with higher biomass than those deforested in the past, resulting in smaller reductions in carbon dioxide emissions than expected purely from the recent reductions in deforestation rates; and (iv) the current official estimate of carbon emissions from Amazonian deforestation is probably overestimated, because the recent loss of higher-biomass forests has not been taken into account.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Ometto","given":"Jean Pierre"},{"family":"Aguiar","given":"Ana Paula"},{"family":"Assis","given":"Talita"},{"family":"Soler","given":"Luciana"},{"family":"Valle","given":"Pedro"},{"family":"Tejada","given":"Graciela"},{"family":"Lapola","given":"David M.

This paper presents a new forest above-ground biomass map for the Brazilian Amazon and the associated uncertainty both with a resolution of 250 meters and baseline for the satellite dataset the year of 2016 (i.e., the year of the satellite observation). A significant increase in data availability from forest inventories and remote sensing has enabled progress towards high-resolution biomass estimates. This work uses the largest airborne LiDAR database ever collected in the Amazon, mapping 360,000 km2 through transects distributed in all vegetation categories in the region. The map uses airborne laser scanning (ALS) data calibrated by field forest inventories that are extrapolated to the region using a machine learning approach with inputs from Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR), vegetation indices obtained from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite, and precipitation information from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). A total of 174 field inventories geolocated using a Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) were used to validate the biomass estimations. The experimental design allowed for a comprehensive representation of several vegetation types, producing an above-ground biomass map varying from a maximum value of 518 Mg ha−1, a mean of 174 Mg ha−1, and a standard deviation of 102 Mg ha−1. This unique dataset enabled a better representation of the regional distribution of the forest biomass and structure, providing further studies and critical information for decision-making concerning forest conservation, planning, carbon emissions estimate, and mechanisms for supporting carbon emissions reductions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Ometto","given":"Jean Pierre"},{"family":"Gorgens","given":"Eric Bastos"},{"family":"Souza Pereira","given":"Francisca Rocha","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Sato","given":"Luciane"},{"family":"Assis","given":"Mauro Lúcio Rodrigures","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Cantinho","given":"Roberta"},{"family":"Longo","given":"Marcos"},{"family":"Jacon","given":"Aline Daniele"},{"family":"Keller","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"omettoBiomassMapBrazilian2023","container-title":"Scientific Data","container-title-short":"Sci Data","DOI":"10.1038/s41597-023-02575-4","ISSN":"2052-4463","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,30]]},"language":"en","license":"2023 Springer Nature Limited","number":"1","page":"668","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"A biomass map of the Brazilian Amazon from multisource remote sensing","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02575-4","volume":"10"},

PLoS Negl Trop Dis 12(6): e0006587. https://doi.org/10.1371/ journal.pntd.0006587 Singapore experiences endemic dengue, with 2013 being the largest outbreak year known to date, culminating in 22,170 cases. Given the limited resources available, and that vector control is the key approach for prevention in Singapore, it is important that public health professionals know where resources should be invested in. This study aims to stratify the spatial risk of dengue transmission in Singapore for effective deployment of resources.

Data Availability Statement: The dengue risk map described in the manuscript uses geo-referenced dengue case data which reveal patient’s locality and hence compromise patient privacy. Thus, the data could not be made available due to patient confidentiality. However, qualified researchers could contact Ministry of Health, Singapore for access to the case data at Vernon_LEE@moh.gov. sg\nMethodology/principal findings Random Forest was used to predict the risk rank of dengue transmission in 1km2 grids, with dengue, population, entomological and environmental data. The predicted risk ranks are categorized and mapped to four color-coded risk groups for easy operation application. The risk maps were evaluated with dengue case and cluster data. Risk maps produced by Random Forest have high accuracy. More than 80% of the observed risk ranks fell within the 80% prediction interval. The observed and predicted risk ranks were highly correlated (r !0.86, P <0.01). Furthermore, the predicted risk levels were in excellent agreement with case density, a weighted Kappa coefficient of more than 0.80 (P <0.01). Close to 90% of the dengue clusters occur in high risk areas, and the odds of cluster forming in high risk areas were higher than in low risk areas.\nConclusions This study demonstrates the potential of Random Forest and its strong predictive capability in stratifying the spatial risk of dengue transmission in Singapore. Dengue risk map produced using Random Forest has high accuracy, and is a good surveillance tool to guide vector control operations.

  {"id":"ortega-pieckEarlySeedlingEstablishment2011","abstract":"Tropical montane cloud forest has been undergoing a drastic reduction because of its widespread conversion to pastures. Once these forests have been cleared exotic grasses are deliberately introduced for forage production. Exotic grass species commonly form monodominant stands and produce more biomass than native grass species, resulting in the inhibition of secondary succession and tree regeneration. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of native vs. exotic grass species on the early establishment of two native tree seedlings (Mexican alder, Alnus acuminata and Jalapa oak, Quercus xalapensis) on an abandoned farm in central Veracruz, Mexico. Seedling survival and growth were monitored (over 46 weeks) in relation to grass cover and height, and available photosynthetic active radiation (PAR). More seedlings survived in the presence of the native grass Panicum glutinosum than those growing with the exotic grass Cynodon plectostachyus (92% vs. 48%). The causes of seedling mortality varied between species; Q. xalapensis was affected by herbivory by voles but mainly in the exotic grass-dominated stands, whereas A. acuminata seedlings died due to competition with the exotic grass. A. acuminata seedlings increased more in height in the exotic grass-dominated stands (102 ± 7.8 cm) compared to native grass-dominated stands (51 ± 4.7 cm). Grass layer height, cover and available PAR were correlated (Pearson; p < 0.05). In the exotic grass dominated plots, grass layer height was correlated with the relative height growth rates of Q. xalapensis (Pearson; p < 0.05). These results indicate that the exotic grass may be affecting tree regeneration directly (grass competition) and indirectly (higher herbivory). Passive restoration may occur once P. glutinosum dominated pastures are abandoned. However, when C. plectostachyus dominates, introduction of early and mid successional tree seedlings protected against vole damage is needed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Ortega-Pieck","given":"Aline"},{"family":"López-Barrera","given":"Fabiola"},{"family":"Ramírez-Marcial","given":"Neptalí"},{"family":"García-Franco","given":"José G."}],"citation-key":"ortega-pieckEarlySeedlingEstablishment2011","container-title":"Forest Ecology and Management","container-title-short":"Forest Ecology and Management","DOI":"10.1016/j.foreco.2011.01.013","ISSN":"03781127","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",4]]},"language":"en","page":"1336-1343","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Early seedling establishment of two tropical montane cloud forest tree species: The role of native and exotic grasses","title-short":"Early seedling establishment of two tropical montane cloud forest tree species","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378112711000363","volume":"261"},

Of particular interest are the effects of land use changes, such as deforestation-driven urbanization and forest degradation, on the incidence and prevalence of these diseases, which are not well understood. In recent years, parts of Central America have experienced social and economic improvements; however, the region still faces major challenges in developing effective strategies and signiﬁcant investments in public health infrastructure to prevent and control these diseases. In this article, we review the current knowledge and potential impacts of deforestation, urbanization, and other land use changes on mosquito-borne and tick-borne disease transmission in Central America and how these anthropogenic drivers could affect the risk for disease emergence and resurgence in the region.

However, the scale of these eﬀorts combined with the timeframe in which they are supposed to take place may compromise the quality of restoration, and thus limit the persistence of restoration on the landscape. This paper presents a synthesis of ten case studies identiﬁed as FLR to critically analyse implemented initiatives, their outcomes, and main challenges, with an eye to improving future eﬀorts. The identiﬁed FLR projects are diverse in terms of their spatial coverage, objectives; types of interventions; and initial socioeconomic, institutional, and environmental conditions. The six principles of FLR—which have been widely adopted in theory by large global organisations—are inadequately addressed across the initiatives presented here. The identiﬁed FLR project or interventions, although expected to oﬀer diverse beneﬁts, face many challenges including the lack of long-term sustainability of project interventions, limited uptake by regional and national agencies, limited monitoring, reporting and learning, poor governance structures, and technical barriers, which are mainly owing to institutional weaknesses. On the basis of these cases, we propose that the best pathway to achieving FLR is via an incremental process in which a smaller number of more achievable objectives are set and implemented over time, rather than setting highly ambitious targets that implementers struggle to achieve.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Ota","given":"Liz"},{"family":"Chazdon","given":"Robin L."},{"family":"Herbohn","given":"John"},{"family":"Gregorio","given":"Nestor"},{"family":"Mukul","given":"Sharif A."},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Sarah J."}],"citation-key":"otaAchievingQualityForest2020","container-title":"Forests","container-title-short":"Forests","DOI":"10.3390/f11080820","ISSN":"1999-4907","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,28]]},"language":"en","page":"820","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Achieving Quality Forest and Landscape Restoration in the Tropics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/11/8/820","volume":"11"},
  {"id":"pacheco-labradorGeneralizableNormalizationAssessing2023","abstract":"Remote sensing (RS) increasingly seeks to produce global-coverage maps of plant functional diversity (PFD) across scales. PFD can be quantified with metrics assessing field or RS data dissimilarity. However, their comparison suffers from the lack of normalization approaches that (1) correct for differences in the number and correlation of traits and spectral variables and (2) do not require comparing all the available samples to estimate the maximum trait's dissimilarity (unfeasible in RS). We propose a generalizable normalization (GN) based on the maximum potential dissimilarity for the traits and spectral data considered and compare it to more traditional approaches (e.g. the maximum dissimilarity within datasets). To do so, we simulated plant communities with radiative transfer models and compared RS-based diversity measurements across spatial scales (α- and β-diversity components). Specifically, we assessed the capability of different normalization approaches (GN, local, none) to provide PFD estimates comparable between (1) RS and plant traits and (2) estimates from different RS missions. Unlike the other approaches, GN provides diversity component estimates that are directly comparable between field data and RS missions with different spectral configurations by removing the effect of differences in the number of traits or bands and the maximum dissimilarity across datasets. Therefore, GN enables the separated analysis of RS images from different sensors to produce comparable global-coverage cartography. We suggest GN is necessary to validate RS approaches and develop interpretable maps of PFD using different RS missions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Pacheco-Labrador","given":"Javier"},{"family":"Bello","given":"Francesco","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Migliavacca","given":"Mirco"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Xuanlong"},{"family":"Carvalhais","given":"Nuno"},{"family":"Wirth","given":"Christian"}],"citation-key":"pacheco-labradorGeneralizableNormalizationAssessing2023","container-title":"Methods in Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/2041-210X.14163","ISSN":"2041-210X","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2023 The Authors.

  {"id":"paineGloballyFunctionalTraits2015","abstract":"Plant functional traits, in particular specific leaf area (SLA), wood density and seed mass, are often good predictors of individual tree growth rates within communities. Individuals and species with high SLA, low wood density and small seeds tend to have faster growth rates. If community-level relationships between traits and growth have general predictive value, then similar relationships should also be observed in analyses that integrate across taxa, biogeographic regions and environments. Such global consistency would imply that traits could serve as valuable proxies for the complex suite of factors that determine growth rate, and, therefore, could underpin a new generation of robust dynamic vegetation models. Alternatively, growth rates may depend more strongly on the local environment or growth–trait relationships may vary along environmental gradients. We tested these alternative hypotheses using data on 27 352 juvenile trees, representing 278 species from 27 sites on all forested continents, and extensive functional trait data, 38% of which were obtained at the same sites at which growth was assessed. Data on potential evapotranspiration (PET), which summarizes the joint ecological effects of temperature and precipitation, were obtained from a global data base. We estimated size-standardized relative height growth rates (SGR) for all species, then related them to functional traits and PET using mixed-effect models for the fastest growing species and for all species together. Both the mean and 95th percentile SGR were more strongly associated with functional traits than with PET. PET was unrelated to SGR at the global scale. SGR increased with increasing SLA and decreased with increasing wood density and seed mass, but these traits explained only 3.1% of the variation in SGR. SGR–trait relationships were consistently weak across families and biogeographic zones, and over a range of tree statures. Thus, the most widely studied functional traits in plant ecology were poor predictors of tree growth over large scales. Synthesis. We conclude that these functional traits alone may be unsuitable for predicting growth of trees over broad scales. Determining the functional traits that predict vital rates under specific environmental conditions may generate more insight than a monolithic global relationship can offer.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Paine","given":"C.

  {"id":"pattersonStatisticalPropertiesHybrid2019","abstract":"NASA’s Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) mission will collect waveform lidar data at a dense sample of ∼25 m footprints along ground tracks paralleling the orbit of the International Space Station (ISS). GEDI’s primary science deliverable will be a 1 km grid of estimated mean aboveground biomass density (Mg ha−1), covering the latitudes overflown by ISS (51.6 °S to 51.6 °N). One option for using the sample of waveforms contained within an individual grid cell to produce an estimate for that cell is hybrid inference, which explicitly incorporates both sampling design and model parameter covariance into estimates of variance around the population mean. We explored statistical properties of hybrid estimators applied in the context of GEDI, using simulations calibrated with lidar and field data from six diverse sites across the United States. We found hybrid estimators of mean biomass to be unbiased and the corresponding estimators of variance appeared to be asymptotically unbiased, with under-estimation of variance by approximately 20% when data from only two clusters (footprint tracks) were available. In our study areas, sampling error contributed more to overall estimates of variance than variability due to the model, and it was the design-based component of the variance that was the source of the variance estimator bias at small sample sizes. These results highlight the importance of maximizing GEDI’s sample size in making precise biomass estimates. Given a set of assumptions discussed here, hybrid inference provides a viable framework for estimating biomass at the scale of a 1 km grid cell while formally accounting for both variability due to the model and sampling error.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Patterson","given":"Paul L."},{"family":"Healey","given":"Sean P."},{"family":"Ståhl","given":"Göran"},{"family":"Saarela","given":"Svetlana"},{"family":"Holm","given":"Sören"},{"family":"Andersen","given":"Hans-Erik"},{"family":"Dubayah","given":"Ralph O."},{"family":"Duncanson","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Hancock","given":"Steven"},{"family":"Armston","given":"John"},{"family":"Kellner","given":"James R."},{"family":"Cohen","given":"Warren B."},{"family":"Yang","given":"Zhiqiang"}],"citation-key":"pattersonStatisticalPropertiesHybrid2019","container-title":"Environ.

  {"id":"pavinatoRevealingSoilLegacy2020","abstract":"Abstract\n            Exploiting native soil phosphorus (P) and the large reservoirs of residual P accumulated over decades of cultivation, namely “legacy P”, has great potential to overcome the high demand of P fertilisers in Brazilian cropping systems. Long-term field experiments have shown that a large proportion (> 70%) of the surplus P added via fertilisers remains in the soil, mainly in forms not readily available to crops. An important issue is if the amount of legacy P mobilized from soil is sufficient for the crop nutritional demand and over how long this stored soil P can be effectively ‘mined’ by crops in a profitable way. Here we mapped the spatial–temporal distribution of legacy P over the past 50 years, and discussed possible agricultural practices that could increase soil legacy P usage by plants in Brazil. Mineral fertiliser and manure applications have resulted in ~ 33.4 Tg of legacy P accumulated in the agricultural soils from 1967 to 2016, with a current annual surplus rate of 1.6 Tg. Following this same rate, soil legacy P may reach up to 106.5 Tg by 2050. Agricultural management practices to enhance soil legacy P usage by crops includes increasing soil pH by liming, crop rotation, double-cropping, inter-season cover crops, no-tillage system and use of modern fertilisers, in addition to more efficient crop varieties and inoculation with P solubilising microorganisms. The adoption of these practices could increase the use efficiency of P, substantially reducing the new input of fertilisers and thus save up to 31.8 Tg of P fertiliser use (US$ 20.8 billion) in the coming decades. Therefore, exploring soil legacy P is imperative to reduce the demand for mineral fertilisers while promoting long-term P sustainability in Brazil.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Pavinato","given":"Paulo S."},{"family":"Cherubin","given":"Maurício R."},{"family":"Soltangheisi","given":"Amin"},{"family":"Rocha","given":"Gustavo C."},{"family":"Chadwick","given":"Dave R."},{"family":"Jones","given":"Davey L."}],"citation-key":"pavinatoRevealingSoilLegacy2020","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-020-72302-1","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",9,28]]},"language":"en","page":"15615","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Revealing soil legacy phosphorus to promote sustainable agriculture in Brazil","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-72302-1","volume":"10"},
  {"id":"pedersenNonhierarchicalDispersalPromotes2016","abstract":"Community interactions (e.g., predation, competition) can be characterized by two factors: their strengths and how they are structured between and within species. Both factors play a role in determining community dynamics. In addition to trophic interactions, dispersal acts as an interaction between separate populations. As with other interactions, the structure of dispersal can affect the stability of a system. However, the primary structure that has been studied in consumer-resource models has been hierarchical dispersal, where between-patch dispersal rates increase with trophic level. Here we use analytical, numerical, and simulation approaches on a two-patch, three-species metacommunity model to investigate the relationship between structure and community stability and resilience. We show that metacommunity stability is greater in systems with both weak and strong dispersal rates. Our system is stabilized by the formation of patterns when predators disperse frequently and herbivores disperse rarely, and via asynchrony when both predators and herbivores disperse infrequently. Our results show how interaction strengths within both trophic and spatial networks shape metacommunity stability.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Pedersen","given":"Eric J."},{"family":"Marleau","given":"Justin N."},{"family":"Granados","given":"Monica"},{"family":"Moeller","given":"Holly V."},{"family":"Guichard","given":"Frédéric"}],"citation-key":"pedersenNonhierarchicalDispersalPromotes2016","container-title":"The American Naturalist","DOI":"10.1086/685773","ISSN":"0003-0147","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",5]]},"page":"E116-E128","publisher":"The University of Chicago Press","source":"journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","title":"Nonhierarchical Dispersal Promotes Stability and Resilience in a Tritrophic Metacommunity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/685773","volume":"187"},

  {"id":"pelletierTraditionalShiftingAgriculture2012","abstract":"Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) requires developing countries to quantify greenhouse gas emissions and removals from forests in a manner that is robust, transparent, and as accurate as possible. Although shifting cultivation is a dominant practice in several developing countries, there is still very limited information available on how to monitor this land-use practice for REDD+ as little is known about the areas of shifting cultivation or the net carbon balance. In this study, we propose and test a methodology to monitor the effect of the shifting cultivation on above-ground carbon stocks. We combine multiyear remote sensing information, taken from a 12-year period, with an in-depth community forest carbon stock inventory in Palo Seco Forest Reserve, western Panama. Using remote sensing, we were able to separate four forest classes expressing different forest-use intensity and time-since-intervention, which demonstrate expected trends in above-ground carbon stocks. The addition of different interventions observed over time is shown to be a good predictor, with remote sensing variables explaining 64.2% of the variation in forest carbon stocks in cultivated landscapes. Multitemporal and multispectral medium-resolution satellite imagery is shown to be adequate for tracking land-use dynamics of the agriculture-fallow cycle. The results also indicate that, over time, shifting cultivation has a transitory effect on forest carbon stocks in the study area. This is due to the rapid recovery of forest carbon stocks, which results in limited net emissions. Finally, community participation yielded important additional beneﬁts to measuring carbon stocks, including transparency and the valorization of local knowledge for biodiversity monitoring. Our study provides important inputs regarding shifting cultivation, which should be taken into consideration when national forest monitoring systems are created, given the context of REDD+ safeguards.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Pelletier","given":"Johanne"},{"family":"Codjia","given":"Claude"},{"family":"Potvin","given":"Catherine"}],"citation-key":"pelletierTraditionalShiftingAgriculture2012","container-title":"Global Change Biology","container-title-short":"Glob Change Biol","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-2486.2012.02788.x","ISSN":"13541013","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",12]]},"language":"en","page":"3581-3595","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Traditional shifting agriculture: tracking forest carbon stock and biodiversity through time in western Panama","title-short":"Traditional shifting agriculture","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2012.02788.x","volume":"18"},

  {"id":"pereiracabralgomesPostagriculturalSuccessionFallow2020","abstract":"Agricultural practices have been occurring for centuries in the Brazilian Atlantic Rain Forest, which contains one of the highest levels of biodiversity in the world. The communities that still practice traditional shifting agriculture are constrained by legal, economic and social factors, which makes the practice of itinerant agriculture a complex dynamic process. The long-term effect of repeated, long-fallow shifting cultivation on plant communities in secondary forest fallows of various age and slash-and-burn history was examined in a quilombola village in Southeastern Brazil. We carried out vegetation surveys in 12 sites, ten in areas of shifting cultivation and two in secondary forests formed after natural disturbances. We chose three age groups for sampling, i.e., post-harvest fallow or post-disruption times for natural areas. The fallow period after cultivation ensures the continuous recovery of the composition and structure of vegetation, but even after five decades the alpha and beta diversities had not reached the values observed in mature forests. The number of species and basal area increased over time but the differences between areas in the same age group were as large as between age groups. The two disturbed natural areas had lower richness than the fallow swiddens of the same age. The data suggest that the intensive extraction of non-timber forest products to supply the market, and therefore extraneous to traditional activity, has negatively affected the sustainability of the system. Actions to recover stocks of these forest products together with integrated management and input of resources can maintain the sustainability of the system.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Pereira Cabral Gomes","given":"Eduardo"},{"family":"Sugiyama","given":"Marie"},{"family":"Fernandes de Oliveira Junior","given":"Clóvis José"},{"family":"Medeiros Prado","given":"Helbert"},{"family":"Antunes Ribeiro Filho","given":"Alexandre"},{"family":"Adams","given":"Cristina"}],"citation-key":"pereiracabralgomesPostagriculturalSuccessionFallow2020","container-title":"Forest Ecology and Management","container-title-short":"Forest Ecology and Management","DOI":"10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118398","ISSN":"03781127","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",11]]},"language":"en","page":"118398","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Post-agricultural succession in the fallow swiddens of Southeastern Brazil","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378112720311671","volume":"475"},
  {"id":"perez-cardenasEffectsLandscapeComposition2021","abstract":"Regenerating forests after agricultural land abandonment are increasingly common in human-modified tropical landscapes. These secondary forests preserve biodiversity and provide multiple ecosystem services, but such important roles depend on their recovery rates, which can be difficult to predict. Recovery is expected to occur faster when landscape composition favors seed dispersal to the regenerating site, and when previous land-use does not significantly reduce propagule bank or future plant growth. Here, we test such expectations for the recovery of a Mexican tropical dry forest during secondary succession. For this purpose, we measured several indicators of landscape composition and site land-use intensity in 30 regenerating sites located along gradients of age of abandonment and amount of surrounding forest. Generalized linear models and redundancy analysis were fitted to test if values of four vegetation properties (aboveground biomass, total and dominant species diversity, and species composition) were indicative of such effects. We found evidence that, as expected, species richness recovers faster in sites surrounded by higher forest cover, while aboveground biomass recovers slower as sur­ rounding pasture cover increases. Species composition was also significantly but poorly explained by the interaction between age of abandonment and the amount of forest cover. Contrary to our expectations, we found weak evidence on the impact of site land-use intensity on all vegetation properties, except on the number of dominant species, which showed higher values in sites with higher land-use intensity. Our findings show that landscape context plays a major role in structuring successional plant communities in this tropical dry region, even stronger than site land-use intensity. This seems to be related to the influence of landscape patterns on dispersal and recruitment limitation, but also on the likelihood of further human disturbances. Therefore, conserving landscape quality is paramount to enhance forest recovery and its contribution to the preservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Pérez-Cárdenas","given":"Nathalia"},{"family":"Mora","given":"Francisco"},{"family":"Arreola-Villa","given":"Felipe"},{"family":"Arroyo-Rodríguez","given":"Víctor"},{"family":"Balvanera","given":"Patricia"},{"family":"Flores-Casas","given":"Rolando"},{"family":"Navarrete-Pacheco","given":"Antonio"},{"family":"Ortega-Huerta","given":"Miguel A."}],"citation-key":"perez-cardenasEffectsLandscapeComposition2021","container-title":"Forest Ecology and Management","container-title-short":"Forest Ecology and Management","DOI":"10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118818","ISSN":"03781127","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",2]]},"language":"en","page":"118818","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Effects of landscape composition and site land-use intensity on secondary succession in a tropical dry forest","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378112720315875","volume":"482"},

Here, we couple field experiments under two contrasting climatic conditions to a plant population model describing competitive dynamics between 10 annual plant species in order to evaluate how 19 functional traits, covering physiological, morphological and reproductive characteristics, are associated with species’ niche and fitness differences. We find a rich diversity of univariate and multidimensional associations, which highlight the primary role of traits related to water- and light-use-efficiency for modulating the determinants of competitive outcomes. Importantly, such traits and their plasticity promote species coexistence across climatic conditions by enhancing stabilizing niche differences and by generating competitive trade-offs between species. Our study represents a significant advance showing how leading dimensions of plant function connect to the mechanisms determining the maintenance of biodiversity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Pérez-Ramos","given":"Ignacio M."},{"family":"Matías","given":"Luis"},{"family":"Gómez-Aparicio","given":"Lorena"},{"family":"Godoy","given":"Óscar"}],"citation-key":"perez-ramosFunctionalTraitsPhenotypic2019","container-title":"Nature Communications","container-title-short":"Nat Commun","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-019-10453-0","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,11]]},"language":"en","license":"2019 The Author(s)","number":"1","page":"2555","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www-nature-com.proxy3.library.mcgill.ca","title":"Functional traits and phenotypic plasticity modulate species coexistence across contrasting climatic conditions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10453-0","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"pessoaProtectedAreasAre2023","abstract":"The assessment of whether protected areas (PAs) inhibit environmentally damaging fires is challenged by three sources of bias: (i) non-random site protection, (ii) influence of simultaneous land use and environmental changes, and (iii) unobservable time-invariant fire predictors. These biases were mitigated here with a quasi-experimental approach combining matching, differences-and-differences and the fixed-effects estimator. An extensive pixel-level dataset covering the 6 million km2 of the Amazon region across 18 years was analyzed. The five types of PAs considered differed on governmental level (national or subnational) and protection stringency (permitting either indirect or direct use of resources, or only indigenous inhabitants). Results attested PAs' effectiveness in containing fires on average, although in a degree 1.4 orders of magnitude smaller than in biased estimation. Still, the effect was considerable, with fire likelihood reduced, depending on the fire measure, in 7% or 12% in the average pixel-year. Also, the effect was heterogeneous, being larger in subnational PAs, albeit not with indirect use permitted, whereas national direct use PAs did not avoid fires. Results were robust to clustered standard errors and, in a reasonable degree, to Rosenbaum's hidden bias test. Consequently, expanding subnational PAs and enforcing all PA types could curb fires' environmental damages.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Pessôa","given":"Ana Carolina M."},{"family":"Morello R.S.","given":"Thiago F."},{"family":"Silva-Junior","given":"Celso H.

  {"id":"petersGrowthEmissionTransfers2011","abstract":"Despite the emergence of regional climate policies, growth in global CO2 emissions has remained strong. From 1990 to 2008 CO2 emissions in developed countries (defined as countries with emission-reduction commitments in the Kyoto Protocol, Annex B) have stabilized, but emissions in developing countries (non-Annex B) have doubled. Some studies suggest that the stabilization of emissions in developed countries was partially because of growing imports from developing countries. To quantify the growth in emission transfers via international trade, we developed a trade-linked global database for CO2 emissions covering 113 countries and 57 economic sectors from 1990 to 2008. We find that the emissions from the production of traded goods and services have increased from 4.3 Gt CO2 in 1990 (20% of global emissions) to 7.8 Gt CO2 in 2008 (26%). Most developed countries have increased their consumption-based emissions faster than their territorial emissions, and non–energy-intensive manufacturing had a key role in the emission transfers. The net emission transfers via international trade from developing to developed countries increased from 0.4 Gt CO2 in 1990 to 1.6 Gt CO2 in 2008, which exceeds the Kyoto Protocol emission reductions. Our results indicate that international trade is a significant factor in explaining the change in emissions in many countries, from both a production and consumption perspective. We suggest that countries monitor emission transfers via international trade, in addition to territorial emissions, to ensure progress toward stabilization of global greenhouse gas emissions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Peters","given":"Glen P."},{"family":"Minx","given":"Jan C."},{"family":"Weber","given":"Christopher L."},{"family":"Edenhofer","given":"Ottmar"}],"citation-key":"petersGrowthEmissionTransfers2011","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1006388108","issue":"21","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",5,24]]},"page":"8903-8908","publisher":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","source":"www-pnas-org.proxy3.library.mcgill.ca (Atypon)","title":"Growth in emission transfers via international trade from 1990 to 2008","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1006388108","volume":"108"},

  {"id":"phillipsCarbonUptakeMature2017","abstract":"Background:  Several independent lines of evidence suggest that Amazon forests have provided a significant carbon sink service, and also that the Amazon carbon sink in intact, mature forests may now be threatened as a result of different processes. There has however been no work done to quantify non-land-use-change forest carbon fluxes on a national basis within Amazonia, or to place these national fluxes and their possible changes in the context of the major anthropogenic carbon fluxes in the region. Here we present a first attempt to interpret results from groundbased monitoring of mature forest carbon fluxes in a biogeographically, politically, and temporally differentiated way. Specifically, using results from a large long-term network of forest plots, we estimate the Amazon biomass carbon balance over the last three decades for the different regions and nine nations of Amazonia, and evaluate the magnitude and trajectory of these differentiated balances in relation to major national anthropogenic carbon emissions.\nResults:  The sink of carbon into mature forests has been remarkably geographically ubiquitous across Amazonia, being substantial and persistent in each of the five biogeographic regions within Amazonia. Between 1980 and 2010, it has more than mitigated the fossil fuel emissions of every single national economy, except that of Venezuela. For most nations (Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname) the sink has probably additionally mitigated all anthropogenic carbon emissions due to Amazon deforestation and other land use change. While the sink has weakened in some regions since 2000, our analysis suggests that Amazon nations which are able to conserve large areas of natural and semi-natural landscape still contribute globally-significant carbon sequestration.\nConclusions:  Mature forests across all of Amazonia have contributed significantly to mitigating climate change for decades. Yet Amazon nations have not directly benefited from providing this global scale ecosystem service. We suggest that better monitoring and reporting of the carbon fluxes within mature forests, and understanding the drivers of changes in their balance, must become national, as well as international, priorities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Phillips","given":"Oliver L."},{"family":"Brienen","given":"Roel J.

  {"id":"phillipsSpeciesMatterWood2019","abstract":"The mass of carbon contained in trees is governed by the volume and density of their wood. This represents a challenge to most remote sensing technologies, which typically detect surface structure and parameters related to wood volume but not to its density. Since wood density is largely determined by taxonomic identity this challenge is greatest in tropical forests where there are tens of thousands of tree species. Here, using pan-tropical literature and new analyses in Amazonia with plots with reliable identifications we assess the impact that species-related variation in wood density has on biomass estimates of mature tropical forests. We find impacts of species on forest biomass due to wood density at all scales from the individual tree up to the whole biome: variation in tree species composition regulates how much carbon forests can store. Even local differences in composition can cause variation in forest biomass and carbon density of 20% between subtly different local forest types, while additional large-scale floristic variation leads to variation in mean wood density of 10–30% across Amazonia and the tropics. Further, because species composition varies at all scales and even vertically within a stand, our analysis shows that bias and uncertainty always result if individual identity is ignored. Since sufficient inventory-based evidence based on botanical identification now exists to show that species composition matters biome-wide for biomass, we here assemble and provide mean basal-area-weighted wood density values for different forests across the lowand tropical biome. These range widely, from 0.467 to 0.728 g cm−3 with a pan-tropical mean of 0.619 g cm−3. Our analysis shows that mapping tropical ecosystem carbon always benefits from locally validated measurement of tree-by-tree botanical identity combined with tree-by-tree measurement of dimensions. Therefore whenever possible, efforts to map and monitor tropical forest carbon using remote sensing techniques should be combined with tree-level measurement of species identity by botanists working in inventory plots.","author":[{"family":"Phillips","given":"Oliver L."},{"family":"Sullivan","given":"Martin J.

  {"id":"phiriDevelopmentsLandsatLand2017","abstract":"Land cover classification of Landsat images is one of the most important applications developed from Earth observation satellites. The last four decades were marked by different developments in land cover classification methods of Landsat images. This paper reviews the developments in land cover classiﬁcation methods for Landsat images from the 1970s to date and highlights key ways to optimize analysis of Landsat images in order to attain the desired results. This review suggests that the development of land cover classiﬁcation methods grew alongside the launches of a new series of Landsat sensors and advancements in computer science. Most classiﬁcation methods were initially developed in the 1970s and 1980s; however, many advancements in speciﬁc classiﬁers and algorithms have occurred in the last decade. The ﬁrst methods of land cover classiﬁcation to be applied to Landsat images were visual analyses in the early 1970s, followed by unsupervised and supervised pixel-based classiﬁcation methods using maximum likelihood, K-means and Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique (ISODAT) classiﬁers. After 1980, other methods such as sub-pixel, knowledge-based, contextual-based, object-based image analysis (OBIA) and hybrid approaches became common in land cover classiﬁcation. Attaining the best classiﬁcation results with Landsat images demands particular attention to the speciﬁcations of each classiﬁcation method such as selecting the right training samples, choosing the appropriate segmentation scale for OBIA, pre-processing calibration, choosing the right classiﬁer and using suitable Landsat images. All these classiﬁcation methods applied on Landsat images have strengths and limitations. Most studies have reported the superior performance of OBIA on different landscapes such as agricultural areas, forests, urban settlements and wetlands; however, OBIA has challenges such as selecting the optimal segmentation scale, which can result in over or under segmentation, and the low spatial resolution of Landsat images. Other classiﬁcation methods have the potential to produce accurate classiﬁcation results when appropriate procedures are followed. More research is needed on the application of hybrid classiﬁers as they are considered more complex methods for land cover classiﬁcation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Phiri","given":"Darius"},{"family":"Morgenroth","given":"Justin"}],"citation-key":"phiriDevelopmentsLandsatLand2017","container-title":"Remote Sensing","container-title-short":"Remote Sensing","DOI":"10.3390/rs9090967","ISSN":"2072-4292","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,19]]},"language":"en","page":"967","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Developments in Landsat Land Cover Classification Methods: A Review","title-short":"Developments in Landsat Land Cover Classification Methods","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/9/9/967","volume":"9"},
  {"id":"phiriSentinel2DataLand2020","abstract":"The advancement in satellite remote sensing technology has revolutionised the approaches to monitoring the Earth’s surface. The development of the Copernicus Programme by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Union (EU) has contributed to the effective monitoring of the Earth’s surface by producing the Sentinel-2 multispectral products. Sentinel-2 satellites are the second constellation of the ESA Sentinel missions and carry onboard multispectral scanners. The primary objective of the Sentinel-2 mission is to provide high resolution satellite data for land cover/use monitoring, climate change and disaster monitoring, as well as complementing the other satellite missions such as Landsat. Since the launch of Sentinel-2 multispectral instruments in 2015, there have been many studies on land cover/use classification which use Sentinel-2 images. However, no review studies have been dedicated to the application of ESA Sentinel-2 land cover/use monitoring. Therefore, this review focuses on two aspects: (1) assessing the contribution of ESA Sentinel-2 to land cover/use classification, and (2) exploring the performance of Sentinel-2 data in different applications (e.g., forest, urban area and natural hazard monitoring). The present review shows that Sentinel-2 has a positive impact on land cover/use monitoring, specifically in monitoring of crop, forests, urban areas, and water resources. The contemporary high adoption and application of Sentinel-2 can be attributed to the higher spatial resolution (10 m) than other medium spatial resolution images, the high temporal resolution of 5 days and the availability of the red-edge bands with multiple applications. The ability to integrate Sentinel-2 data with other remotely sensed data, as part of data analysis, improves the overall accuracy (OA) when working with Sentinel-2 images. The free access policy drives the increasing use of Sentinel-2 data, especially in developing countries where financial resources for the acquisition of remotely sensed data are limited. The literature also shows that the use of Sentinel-2 data produces high accuracies (>80%) with machine-learning classifiers such as support vector machine (SVM) and Random forest (RF). However, other classifiers such as maximum likelihood analysis are also common. Although Sentinel-2 offers many opportunities for land cover/use classification, there are challenges which include mismatching with Landsat OLI-8 data, a lack of thermal bands, and the differences in spatial resolution among the bands of Sentinel-2. Sentinel-2 data show promise and have the potential to contribute significantly towards land cover/use monitoring.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Phiri","given":"Darius"},{"family":"Simwanda","given":"Matamyo"},{"family":"Salekin","given":"Serajis"},{"family":"Nyirenda","given":"Vincent"},{"family":"Murayama","given":"Yuji"},{"family":"Ranagalage","given":"Manjula"}],"citation-key":"phiriSentinel2DataLand2020","container-title":"Remote Sensing","container-title-short":"Remote Sensing","DOI":"10.3390/rs12142291","ISSN":"2072-4292","issue":"14","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,16]]},"language":"en","page":"2291","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Sentinel-2 Data for Land Cover/Use Mapping: A Review","title-short":"Sentinel-2 Data for Land Cover/Use Mapping","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/14/2291","volume":"12"},

The early and often acrimonious debates about the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning were largely resolved following the advent of a statistical partitioning scheme that decomposed the net effect of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning into a “selection” effect and a “complementarity” effect. Here we show that both the biodiversity effect and its statistical decomposition into selection and complementarity are fundamentally flawed because these methods use a naïve null expectation based on neutrality, likely leading to an overestimate of the net biodiversity effect, and because they fail to account for the nonlinear abundance-ecosystem-functioning relationships widely observed in nature. Furthermore, under nonlinearity no such statistical scheme can be devised to partition the biodiversity effect. We also present an alternative approach that provides a more reasonable starting point for estimating biodiversity effects. Overall, our results suggest that all studies conducted since the early 1990s are likely to have overestimated the positive effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Pillai","given":"Pradeep"},{"family":"Gouhier","given":"Tarik C."}],"citation-key":"pillaiNotEvenWrong2019","container-title":"Ecology","DOI":"10.1002/ecy.2645","ISSN":"1939-9170","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2019 by the Ecological Society of America","page":"e02645","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Not even wrong: the spurious measurement of biodiversity's effects on ecosystem functioning","title-short":"Not even wrong","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ecy.2645","volume":"100"},
  {"id":"poorterAreFunctionalTraits2008","abstract":"A central goal of comparative plant ecology is to understand how functional traits vary among species and to what extent this variation has adaptive value. Here we evaluate relationships between four functional traits (seed volume, specific leaf area, wood density, and adult stature) and two demographic attributes (diameter growth and tree mortality) for large trees of 240 tree species from five Neotropical forests. We evaluate how these key functional traits are related to survival and growth and whether similar relationships between traits and demography hold across different tropical forests. There was a tendency for a trade-off between growth and survival across rain forest tree species. Wood density, seed volume, and adult stature were significant predictors of growth and/or mortality. Both growth and mortality rates declined with an increase in wood density. This is consistent with greater construction costs and greater resistance to stem damage for denser wood. Growth and mortality rates also declined as seed volume increased. This is consistent with an adaptive syndrome in which species tolerant of low resource availability (in this case shade-tolerant species) have large seeds to establish successfully and low inherent growth and mortality rates. Growth increased and mortality decreased with an increase in adult stature, because taller species have a greater access to light and longer life spans. Specific leaf area was, surprisingly, only modestly informative for the performance of large trees and had ambiguous relationships with growth and survival. Single traits accounted for 9-55% of the interspecific variation in growth and mortality rates at individual sites. Significant correlations with demographic rates tended to be similar across forests and for phylogenetically independent contrasts as well as for cross-species analyses that treated each species as an independent observation. In combination, the morphological traits explained 41% of the variation in growth rate and 54% of the variation in mortality rate, with wood density being the best predictor of growth and mortality. Relationships between functional traits and demographic rates were statistically similar across a wide range of Neotropical forests. The consistency of these results strongly suggests that tropical rain forest species face similar trade-offs in different sites and converge on similar sets of solutions.","author":[{"family":"Poorter","given":"L."},{"family":"Wright","given":"S.

This study aims to relate aboveground biomass (AGB) and biomass dynamics (i.e., net biomass productivity and its underlying demographic drivers: biomass recruitment, growth and mortality) to forest attributes (tree diversity, community-mean traits and stand basal area) and environmental conditions (water availability, soil fertility and disturbance). Location Neotropics. Methods We used data from 26 sites, 201 1-ha plots and >92,000 trees distributed across the Neotropics. We quantified for each site water availability and soil total exchangeable bases and for each plot three key community-weighted mean functional traits that are important for biomass stocks and productivity. We used structural equation models to test the hypothesis that all drivers have independent, positive effects on biomass stocks and dynamics. Results Of the relationships analysed, vegetation attributes were more frequently associated significantly with biomass stocks and dynamics than environmental conditions (in 67 vs. 33% of the relationships). High climatic water availability increased biomass growth and stocks, light disturbance increased biomass growth, and soil bases had no effect. Rarefied tree species richness had consistent positive relationships with biomass stocks and dynamics, probably because of niche complementarity, but was not related to net biomass productivity. Community-mean traits were good predictors of biomass stocks and dynamics. Main conclusions Water availability has a strong positive effect on biomass stocks and growth, and a future predicted increase in (atmospheric) drought might, therefore, potentially reduce carbon storage. Forest attributes, including species diversity and community-weighted mean traits, have independent and important relationships with AGB stocks, dynamics and ecosystem functioning, not only in relatively simple temperate systems, but also in structurally complex hyper-diverse tropical forests.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Poorter","given":"Lourens"},{"family":"Sande","given":"Masha T.","non-dropping-particle":"van der"},{"family":"Arets","given":"Eric J.

  {"id":"poorterCanTraitsPredict2018","abstract":"The functional trait approach has, as a central tenet, that plant traits are functional and shape individual performance, but this has rarely been tested in the field. Here, we tested the individual-based trait approach in a hyperdiverse Amazonian tropical rainforest and evaluated intraspecific variation in trait values, plant strategies at the individual level, and whether traits are functional and predict individual performance. We evaluated > 1300 tree saplings belonging to > 383 species, measured 25 traits related to growth and defense, and evaluated the effects of environmental conditions, plant size, and traits on stem growth. A total of 44% of the trait variation was observed within species, indicating a strong potential for acclimation. Individuals showed two strategy spectra, related to tissue toughness and organ size vs leaf display. In this nutrient- and light-limited forest, traits measured at the individual level were surprisingly poor predictors of individual growth performance because of convergence of traits and growth rates. Functional trait approaches based on individuals or species are conceptually fundamentally different: the species-based approach focuses on the potential and the individual-based approach on the realized traits and growth rates. Counterintuitively, the individual approach leads to a poor prediction of individual performance, although it provides a more realistic view on community dynamics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Poorter","given":"Lourens"},{"family":"Castilho","given":"Carolina V."},{"family":"Schietti","given":"Juliana"},{"family":"Oliveira","given":"Rafael S."},{"family":"Costa","given":"Flávia R.

  {"id":"poorterDiversityEnhancesCarbon2015","abstract":"Aim Tropical forests store 25% of global carbon and harbour 96% of the world's tree species, but it is not clear whether this high biodiversity matters for carbon storage. Few studies have teased apart the relative importance of forest attributes and environmental drivers for ecosystem functioning, and no such study exists for the tropics. Location Neotropics. Methods We relate aboveground biomass (AGB) to forest attributes (diversity and structure) and environmental drivers (annual rainfall and soil fertility) using data from 144,000 trees, 2050 forest plots and 59 forest sites. The sites span the complete latitudinal and climatic gradients in the lowland Neotropics, with rainfall ranging from 750 to 4350 mm year−1. Relationships were analysed within forest sites at scales of 0.1 and 1 ha and across forest sites along large-scale environmental gradients. We used a structural equation model to test the hypothesis that species richness, forest structural attributes and environmental drivers have independent, positive effects on AGB. Results Across sites, AGB was most strongly driven by rainfall, followed by average tree stem diameter and rarefied species richness, which all had positive effects on AGB. Our indicator of soil fertility (cation exchange capacity) had a negligible effect on AGB, perhaps because we used a global soil database. Taxonomic forest attributes (i.e. species richness, rarefied richness and Shannon diversity) had the strongest relationships with AGB at small spatial scales, where an additional species can still make a difference in terms of niche complementarity, while structural forest attributes (i.e. tree density and tree size) had strong relationships with AGB at all spatial scales. Main conclusions Biodiversity has an independent, positive effect on AGB and ecosystem functioning, not only in relatively simple temperate systems but also in structurally complex hyperdiverse tropical forests. Biodiversity conservation should therefore be a key component of the UN Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation strategy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Poorter","given":"L."},{"family":"Sande","given":"M.

  {"id":"poorterFunctionalRecoverySecondary2021","abstract":"Significance\n            Tropical forests disappear rapidly through deforestation but also have the potential to regrow naturally through a process called secondary succession. To advance successional theory, it is essential to understand how these secondary forests and their assembly vary across broad spatial scales. We do so by synthesizing continental-scale patterns in succession using a functional trait approach. We show that the start and pathway of succession varies with climatic water availability. In dry forests, succession is driven by drought tolerance traits and in wet forests by shade tolerance traits. Based on these successional principles, we propose an ecologically sound strategy to improve active forest restoration.\n          , \n            One-third of all Neotropical forests are secondary forests that regrow naturally after agricultural use through secondary succession. We need to understand better how and why succession varies across environmental gradients and broad geographic scales. Here, we analyze functional recovery using community data on seven plant characteristics (traits) of 1,016 forest plots from 30 chronosequence sites across the Neotropics. By analyzing communities in terms of their traits, we enhance understanding of the mechanisms of succession, assess ecosystem recovery, and use these insights to propose successful forest restoration strategies. Wet and dry forests diverged markedly for several traits that increase growth rate in wet forests but come at the expense of reduced drought tolerance, delay, or avoidance, which is important in seasonally dry forests. Dry and wet forests showed different successional pathways for several traits. In dry forests, species turnover is driven by drought tolerance traits that are important early in succession and in wet forests by shade tolerance traits that are important later in succession. In both forests, deciduous and compound-leaved trees decreased with forest age, probably because microclimatic conditions became less hot and dry. Our results suggest that climatic water availability drives functional recovery by influencing the start and trajectory of succession, resulting in a convergence of community trait values with forest age when vegetation cover builds up. Within plots, the range in functional trait values increased with age. Based on the observed successional trait changes, we indicate the consequences for carbon and nutrient cycling and propose an ecologically sound strategy to improve forest restoration success.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Poorter","given":"Lourens"},{"family":"Rozendaal","given":"Danaë M.

  {"id":"poorterRegenerationPhaseDifferentiation2005","abstract":"1 A height-light trajectory (HLT, a fitted curve relating canopy exposure to tree height) was determined for populations of individuals of each of 47 tree species in a Liberian lowland rainforest. The HLTs were compared and related to tree allometry and adult stature. Crown exposure was measured for 7460 trees and related to tree height using a multinomial regression analysis. Individual trees were followed for 2.8-9.8 years. 2 The trajectories of the 47 species were compared with the average vertical light profile in the forest canopy. Evidence was found for the existence of all nine trajectories hypothesized on the basis of three possible light environments (high, intermediate and low) for juveniles and adults. The classical paradigm of pioneer vs. shade tolerant, based on seed and seedling responses, does not therefore apply to post-seedling stages. 3 The majority of the species followed the vertical light profile in the forest canopy, starting in low light environments in the juvenile stage and ending up in high light environments in the adult stage. Only two species complied with the classic notion of whole-life shade tolerants and whole-life shade intolerants (one each). 4 The predictable vertical light gradient in the forest canopy has led to a close association between adult height, light trajectories and allometric traits. Large-stature species tend to have relatively slender stems and narrow crowns, and therefore realize a faster temporal and height-related increase in crown exposure. 5 Tree species have different height-light trajectories when they grow from seedling to adulthood. This may have profound repercussions for our current views on plasticity and adaptation, light partitioning and species coexistence, and on silviculture and management.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Poorter","given":"Lourens"},{"family":"Bongers","given":"Frans"},{"family":"Sterck","given":"Frank J."},{"family":"Wöll","given":"Hannsjörg"}],"citation-key":"poorterRegenerationPhaseDifferentiation2005","container-title":"Journal of Ecology","ISSN":"0022-0477","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005"]]},"page":"256-267","publisher":"[Wiley, British Ecological Society]","source":"JSTOR","title":"Beyond the Regeneration Phase: Differentiation of Height-Light Trajectories among Tropical Tree Species","title-short":"Beyond the Regeneration Phase","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/3599393","volume":"93"},
  {"id":"poorterSuccessionalTheories","abstract":"Succession is a fundamental concept in ecology because it indicates how species populations, communities, and ecosystems change over time on new substrate or after a disturbance. A mechanistic understanding of succession is needed to predict how ecosystems will respond to land-use change and to design effective ecosystem restoration strategies. Yet, despite a century of conceptual advances a comprehensive successional theory is lacking. Here we provide an overview of 19 successional theories (‘models’) and their key points, group them based on conceptual similarity, explain conceptual development in successional ideas and provide suggestions how to move forward. Four groups of models can be recognised. The first group (patch & plants) focuses on plants at the patch level and consists of three subgroups that originated in the early 20th century. One subgroup focuses on the processes (dispersal, establishment, and performance) that operate sequentially during succession. Another subgroup emphasises individualistic species responses during succession, and how this is driven by species traits. A last subgroup focuses on how vegetation structure and underlying demographic processes change during succession. A second group of models (ecosystems) provides a more holistic view of succession by considering the ecosystem, its biota, interactions, diversity, and ecosystem structure and processes. The third group (landscape) considers a larger spatial scale and includes the effect of the surrounding landscape matrix on succession as the distance to neighbouring vegetation patches determines the potential for seed dispersal, and the quality of the neighbouring patches determines the abundance and composition of seed sources and biotic dispersal vectors. A fourth group (socio-ecological systems) includes the human component by focusing on socio-ecological systems where management practices have long-lasting legacies on successional pathways and where regrowing vegetations deliver a range of ecosystem services to local and global stakeholders. The four groups of models differ in spatial scale (patch, landscape) or organisational level (plant species, ecosystem, socio-ecological system), increase in scale and scope, and reflect the increasingly broader perspective on succession over time. They coincide approximately with four periods that reflect the prevailing view of succession of that time, although all views still coexist. The four successional views are: succession of plants (from 1910 onwards) where succession was seen through the lens of species replacement; succession of communities and ecosystems (from 1965 onwards) when there was a more holistic view of succession; succession in landscapes (from 2000 onwards) when it was realised that the structure and composition of landscapes strongly impact successional pathways, and increased remote-sensing technology allowed for a better quantification of the landscape context; and succession with people (from 2015 onwards) when it was realised that people and societal drivers have strong effects on successional pathways, that ecosystem processes and services are important for human well-being, and that restoration is most successful when it is done by and for local people. Our review suggests that the hierarchical successional framework of Pickett is the best starting point to move forward as this framework already includes several factors, and because it is flexible, enabling application to different systems. The framework focuses mainly on species replacement and could be improved by focusing on succession occurring at different hierarchical scales (population, community, ecosystem, socio-ecological system), and by integrating it with more recent developments and other successional models: by considering different spatial scales (landscape, region), temporal scales (ecosystem processes occurring over centuries, and evolution), and by taking the effects of the surrounding landscape (landscape integrity and composition, the disperser community) and societal factors (previous and current land-use intensity) into account. Such a new, comprehensive framework could be tested using a combination of empirical research, experiments, process-based modelling and novel tools. Applying the framework to seres across broadscale environmental and disturbance gradients allows a better insight into what successional processes matter and under what conditions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Poorter","given":"Lourens"},{"family":"Amissah","given":"Lucy"},{"family":"Bongers","given":"Frans"},{"family":"Hordijk","given":"Iris"},{"family":"Kok","given":"Jazz"},{"family":"Laurance","given":"Susan G.

  {"id":"posUnravelingAmazonTree2023","abstract":"In a time of rapid global change, the question of what determines patterns in species abundance distribution remains a priority for understanding the complex dynamics of ecosystems. The constrained maximization of information entropy provides a framework for the understanding of such complex systems dynamics by a quantitative analysis of important constraints via predictions using least biased probability distributions. We apply it to over two thousand hectares of Amazonian tree inventories across seven forest types and thirteen functional traits, representing major global axes of plant strategies. Results show that constraints formed by regional relative abundances of genera explain eight times more of local relative abundances than constraints based on directional selection for specific functional traits, although the latter does show clear signals of environmental dependency. These results provide a quantitative insight by inference from large-scale data using cross-disciplinary methods, furthering our understanding of ecological dynamics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Pos","given":"Edwin"},{"family":"Souza Coelho","given":"Luiz","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Andrade Lima Filho","given":"Diogenes","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Salomão","given":"Rafael P."},{"family":"Amaral","given":"Iêda Leão"},{"family":"Almeida Matos","given":"Francisca Dionízia","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Castilho","given":"Carolina V."},{"family":"Phillips","given":"Oliver L."},{"family":"Guevara","given":"Juan Ernesto"},{"family":"Jesus Veiga Carim","given":"Marcelo","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"López","given":"Dairon Cárdenas"},{"family":"Magnusson","given":"William E."},{"family":"Wittmann","given":"Florian"},{"family":"Irume","given":"Mariana Victória"},{"family":"Martins","given":"Maria Pires"},{"family":"Sabatier","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Silva Guimarães","given":"José Renan","non-dropping-particle":"da"},{"family":"Molino","given":"Jean-François"},{"family":"Bánki","given":"Olaf S."},{"family":"Piedade","given":"Maria Teresa Fernandez"},{"family":"Pitman","given":"Nigel C.

Here, we employed global Landsat analysis-ready data to extrapolate GEDI footprint-level forest canopy height measurements, creating a 30 m spatial resolution global forest canopy height map for the year 2019. The global forest height map was compared to the GEDI validation data (RMSE = 6.6 m; MAE = 4.45 m, R2 = 0.62) and available airborne lidar data (RMSE = 9.07 m; MAE = 6.36 m, R2 = 0.61).

  {"id":"potvinBiodiversityEnhancesIndividual2008","abstract":"We developed an analytical method that quantifies the relative contributions of mortality and individual growth to ecosystem function and analysed the results from the first biodiversity experiment conducted in a tropical tree plantation. In Sardinilla, central Panama, over 5000 tree seedlings were planted in monoculture and mixedspecies plots. After 5 years of growth, mixed-species plots yielded, on average, 30—58% higher summed tree basal area than did monocultures. Simulation models revealed that the increased yield of mixed-species plots was due mostly to enhancement of individual tree growth. Although c. 1500 trees died during the experiment, mortality was highly species-specific and did not differ consistently between biodiversity treatments. Our results show that the effects of biodiversity on growth and mortality are uncoupled and that biodiversity affects total biomass and potentially self-thinning. The Sardinilla experiment suggests that mixed-species plantings may be a viable strategy for increasing timber yields and preserving biodiversity in tropical tree plantations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Potvin","given":"Catherine"},{"family":"Gotelli","given":"Nicholas J."}],"citation-key":"potvinBiodiversityEnhancesIndividual2008","container-title":"Ecology Letters","container-title-short":"Ecol Letters","DOI":"10.1111/j.1461-0248.2007.01148.x","ISSN":"1461-023X, 1461-0248","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",3]]},"language":"en","page":"217-223","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Biodiversity enhances individual performance but does not affect survivorship in tropical trees","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2007.01148.x","volume":"11"},
  {"id":"potvinEcosystemApproachBiodiversity2011","abstract":"This paper presents a synthesis of experiments conducted in a tropical tree plantation established in 2001 and consisting of 22 plots of 45 m × 45 m with either one, three or six native tree species. We examined the changes in carbon (C) pools (trees, herbaceous vegetation, litter, coarse woody debris (CWD), and mineral topsoil at 0–10 cm depth) and ﬂuxes (decomposition of CWD and litter, as well as soil respiration) both through time and among diversity levels. Between 2001 and 2009 the aboveground C pools increased, driven by trees. Across diversity levels, the mean observed aboveground C pool was 7.9 ± 2.5 Mg ha−1 in 2006 and 20.4 ± 7.4 Mg ha−1 in 2009, a 158% increase. There was no signiﬁcant diversity effect on the observed aboveground C pool, but we found a signiﬁcant decrease in the topsoil C pool, with a mean value of 34.5 ± 2.4 Mg ha−1 in 2001 and of 25.7 ± 5.7 Mg ha−1 in 2009 (F1,36 = 52.12, p < 0.001). Assuming that the biomass C pool in 2001 was negligible (<1 Mg ha−1), then the plantation gained in C, on average, ∼20 and lost ∼9 Mg ha−1 in biomass and soil respectively, for an overall gain of ∼11 Mg ha−1 over 8 years. Across the entire data set, we uncovered signiﬁcant effects of diversity on CWD decomposition (diversity: F2,393 = 15.93, p < 0.001) and soil respiration (monocultures vs mixtures: t = 15.35, df = 11, p < 0.05) and a marginally signiﬁcant time × diversity interaction on the loss of total C from the mineral topsoil pool (see above). Monthly CWD decomposition was signiﬁcantly faster in monocultures (35.0 ± 24.1%) compared with triplets (31.3 ± 21.0%) and six-species mixtures (31.9 ± 26.8%), while soil respiration was higher in monocultures than in mixtures (t = 15.35, df = 11, p < 0.001). Path analyses showed that, as diversity increases, the links among the C pools and ﬂuxes strengthen signiﬁcantly. Our results demonstrate that tree diversity inﬂuences the processes governing the changes in C pools and ﬂuxes following establishment of a tree plantation on a former pasture.

  {"id":"powersEcosystemProcessesBiogeochemical2017","abstract":"Secondary tropical forests that are in a state of regeneration following clearing for agriculture are now more abundant than primary forests. Yet, despite their large spatial extent and important role in the global carbon (C) cycle, secondary tropical forests are understudied, which challenges our ability to predict how tropical landscapes will respond to future disturbance and global change. We summarize research advances on alterations to C and nutrient dynamics during reforestation and how these are influenced by ecosystem state factors. During forest succession, aboveground biomass stocks and litter fluxes increase in a predictable way, but patterns in soil C dynamics are highly variable. The heterogeneous response of nutrients to reforestation is influenced by multiple factors, including losses incurred during prior land use and management. In contrast to primary tropical forests, where productivity is often limited by rock-derived nutrients, secondary forest growth may be more limited by nutrients from the atmosphere. Future research should identify which nutrients constrain forest regrowth.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Powers","given":"Jennifer S."},{"family":"Marín-Spiotta","given":"Erika"}],"citation-key":"powersEcosystemProcessesBiogeochemical2017","container-title":"Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics","DOI":"10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-110316-022944","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"497-519","source":"Annual Reviews","title":"Ecosystem Processes and Biogeochemical Cycles in Secondary Tropical Forest Succession","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-110316-022944","volume":"48"},

Between the extremes, we consider various degrees of active restoration. We suggest a general scheme to determine which approach to use based on site conditions, landscape context and societal circumstances. We conclude that passive restoration should usually be preferred in smaller sites with low abiotic stress and moderate productivity that are recovering from moderate disturbances. A passive approach may also be preferred in those landscapes that are less altered by humans, where target species are common and both invasive aliens and strong competitive generalists are rare. In such landscapes, passive restoration may succeed even if initial disturbances are intense. Potential of passive restoration has not yet been fully utilised.

  {"id":"prado-juniorConservativeSpeciesDrive2016","abstract":"Forests account for a substantial part of the terrestrial biomass storage and productivity. To better understand forest productivity, we need to disentangle the processes underlying net biomass change. We tested how above-ground net biomass change and its underlying biomass dynamics (biomass recruitment, growth and mortality) can be explained by four alternative and contested hypotheses; the soil fertility, biomass ratio, niche complementarity and vegetation quantity hypotheses. Above-ground biomass dynamics were evaluated over a 5-year period in 200 permanent sample plots in 8 tropical dry forests in Brazil, and related to soil fertility, community-weighted mean (CWM) traits that are important for carbon storage and sequestration (wood density, specific leaf area, maximum stem diameter and deciduousness), species richness, functional diversity and initial stand biomass. Initial stand biomass was the best predictor of all three processes of biomass dynamics, providing strong support for the vegetation quantity hypothesis. In these dry forests, the dominance of conservative species, rather than of acquisitive species, is associated with high biomass growth and storage, probably because their low specific leaf area and high wood density allow them to keep on functioning during drought stress. Paradoxically, high soil fertility (Ca) led to low biomass productivity, probably because of nutrient imbalance. In contrast to what is shown for controlled experiments, we found no support for niche complementarity (in terms of functional diversity or species richness) for forest productivity. Biomass storage was favoured by low- rather than high trait diversity, as most of the biomass is concentrated in species with large stem diameter and high wood density. Synthesis. Biomass dynamics are mainly shaped by vegetation quantity, and then by vegetation quality, in line with the mass ratio hypothesis. Dry forests show different trait-productivity relationships than wet forests, as stands with 'slow' trait values are 'fast' in terms of productivity. Diversity matters, but in a different way than expected; high trait diversity does not enhance productivity, but instead, does low trait diversity enhance carbon storage.

  {"id":"prates-clarkImplicationsLanduseHistory2009","abstract":"Understanding the dynamics of forest regeneration on abandoned agricultural land in the Amazon has often been restricted by limited knowledge of historical land use. This study compared time-series classifications of mature forest, nonforest, and regrowth generated from Landsat sensor data for areas north of the Brazilian cities of Manaus (1973–2003) and Santarém (1984–2003) to chronicle land histories and forest age. At Manaus, active land use prior to abandonment ranged from <1 year with no burning to >10–15 years with burning. Few forests were recleared on more than three occasions. From the mid-1980s, land was increasingly abandoned and, in 2003, over 75% of the deforested area supported regenerating forests, with several being older than 20 years. South of Santarém, forests were cleared up to seven times. In 2003, few regenerating forests were older than 10 years, and all land covers, but particularly mature forest, were damaged by extensive wildfires in 1993 and 1998. Based on previous research, the study concludes that the capacity of regenerating forests to recover biomass and tree species diversity will be reduced where prior land use is more intense, as in Santarém and some clearings north of Manaus.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Prates-Clark","given":"Cássia da Conceição"},{"family":"Lucas","given":"Richard M."},{"family":"Santos","given":"João R.","non-dropping-particle":"dos"}],"citation-key":"prates-clarkImplicationsLanduseHistory2009","container-title":"Canadian Journal of Remote Sensing","DOI":"10.5589/m10-004","ISSN":"0703-8992","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",12,1]]},"page":"534-553","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Implications of land-use history for forest regeneration in the Brazilian Amazon","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.5589/m10-004","volume":"35"},
  {"id":"prietoPredictingLandscapescaleBiodiversity2022","abstract":"Natural forest regrowth is a cost-effective, nature-based solution for biodiversity recovery, yet different socioenvironmental factors can lead to variable outcomes. A critical knowledge gap in forest restoration planning is how to predict where natural forest regrowth is likely to lead to high levels of biodiversity recovery, which is an indicator of conservation value and the potential provisioning of diverse ecosystem services. We sought to predict and map landscape-scale recovery of species richness and total abundance of vertebrates, invertebrates, and plants in tropical and subtropical second-growth forests to inform spatial restoration planning. First, we conducted a global meta-analysis to quantify the extent to which recovery of species richness and total abundance in second-growth forests deviated from biodiversity values in reference old-growth forests in the same landscape. Second, we employed a machine-learning algorithm and a comprehensive set of socioenvironmental factors to spatially predict landscape-scale deviation and map it. Models explained on average 34% of observed variance in recovery (range 9–51%). Landscape-scale biodiversity recovery in second-growth forests was spatially predicted based on socioenvironmental landscape factors (human demography, land use and cover, anthropogenic and natural disturbance, ecosystem productivity, and topography and soil chemistry); was significantly higher for species richness than for total abundance for vertebrates (median range-adjusted predicted deviation 0.09 vs. 0.34) and invertebrates (0.2 vs. 0.35) but not for plants (which showed a similar recovery for both metrics [0.24 vs. 0.25]); and was positively correlated for total abundance of plant and vertebrate species (Pearson r = 0.45, p = 0.001). Our approach can help identify tropical and subtropical forest landscapes with high potential for biodiversity recovery through natural forest regrowth.","author":[{"family":"Prieto","given":"Pablo V."},{"family":"Bukoski","given":"Jacob J."},{"family":"Barros","given":"Felipe S.

  {"id":"prioliduarteReducingNaturalVegetation2023","abstract":"The Brazilian Amazon contains the world's largest tract of tropical forest, about 22 % of which is within demarcated indigenous territories. Formal governmental recognition of these traditional territories is often a critical deterrent to deforestation, but the relative conservation performance of Indigenous Lands (ILs) under different legal categories and geographic contexts remains poorly understood. We used 30-m resolution LANDSAT satellite imagery to quantitatively assess the land cover status and annual rates of natural vegetation loss be­ tween 1985 and 2020 for 381 indigenous territories amounting to ~115 million hectares. Using a comprehensive set of environmental and socio-economic covariates and a mixed-modelling approach, we found that all stages of formal IL recognition consistently inhibit natural vegetation loss throughout the Brazilian Amazon compared to adjacent unprotected areas. Formal physical demarcation and distance from roads were the main proximate drivers of avoided natural vegetation loss inside ILs. Forest loss associated with road access is substantially curbed by ILs, showing the importance of frontier expansion when assessing indigenous reserve performance in counteracting natural vegetation loss. Because loss of natural forest and savannah areas associated with agri­ business frontiers and infrastructure projects are likely to intensify, the importance of ecosystem services pro­ vided by ILs is expected to increase across the Brazilian Amazon. Cultural profile and human density exerted no impacts on IL effectiveness in precluding natural vegetation loss. Given widespread encroachment of timber extraction and agribusiness, formal recognition of indigenous territories is a critical factor in decelerating pri­ mary habitat conversion across the Amazon.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Prioli Duarte","given":"Daniela"},{"family":"Peres","given":"Carlos A."},{"family":"Perdomo","given":"Edgar Fernando Cifuentes"},{"family":"Guizar-Coutiño","given":"Alejandro"},{"family":"Nelson","given":"Bruce Walker"}],"citation-key":"prioliduarteReducingNaturalVegetation2023","container-title":"Biological Conservation","container-title-short":"Biological Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/j.biocon.2023.109936","ISSN":"00063207","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",3]]},"language":"en","page":"109936","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Reducing natural vegetation loss in Amazonia critically depends on the formal recognition of indigenous lands","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006320723000368","volume":"279"},

It has been suggested that perturbations to forest demography caused by past land-use change, management, and natural disturbances may be causing a large component of current carbon uptake. Here we use a global compilation of forest age observations, combined with a terrestrial biosphere model with explicit modeling of forest regrowth, to partition the global forest carbon sink between old-growth and regrowth stands over the period 1981–2010. For 2001–2010 we find a carbon sink of 0.85 (0.66–0.96) Pg year\n              −1\n              located in intact old-growth forest, primarily in the moist tropics and boreal Siberia, and 1.30 (1.03–1.96) Pg year\n              −1\n              located in stands regrowing after past disturbance. Approaching half of the sink in regrowth stands would have occurred from demographic changes alone, in the absence of other environmental changes. These age-constrained results show consistency with those simulated using an ensemble of demographically-enabled terrestrial biosphere models following an independent reconstruction of historical land use and management. We estimate that forests will accumulate an additional 69 (44–131) Pg C in live biomass from changes in demography alone if natural disturbances, wood harvest, and reforestation continue at rates comparable to those during 1981–2010. Our results confirm that it is not possible to understand the current global terrestrial carbon sink without accounting for the sizeable sink due to forest demography. They also imply that a large portion of the current terrestrial carbon sink is strictly transient in nature.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Pugh","given":"Thomas A.

This is based on their role in maintaining soil fertility, which can instead be a source of greenhouse gas emissions if not managed properly, while threatening food security. Humid tropical conditions enable intensive agricultural cultivation with various cropping systems to fulﬁll the demand for agriculture products. Such climate accelerates the soil organic matter decomposition rate so that it strongly inﬂuences soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics. However, inappropriate implementation of intensive agricultural systems that does not consider the balance between carbon and nitrogen input and output, negatively aﬀects soil fertility, mainly decreasing soil organic carbon and total soil nitrogen, changing the composition of carbon and nitrogen owing to the loss of soil organic matter through erosion and leaching, thus, causing soil degradation. Mitigation strategies can be performed by using organic matter and crop residue, crop rotation and improvement of crop pattern, soil tillage and fertilization, cover crops and mulch. Sustainable land management for maintenance of soil organic carbon and total soil nitrogen dynamics should be locally and globally developed and adopted for a more sustainable agricultural system. Recovery of soil capacity to accumulate carbon is a strategic step to reduce the impact of climate change. Hence, an intensive study on eﬃcient soil organic carbon management is required to improve food production and mitigation of climate change to attain sustainable development goals in 2030.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Purwanto","given":"Benito Heru"},{"family":"Alam","given":"Syamsu"}],"citation-key":"purwantoImpactIntensiveAgricultural2020","container-title":"Soil Science and Plant Nutrition","container-title-short":"Soil Science and Plant Nutrition","DOI":"10.1080/00380768.2019.1705182","ISSN":"0038-0768, 1747-0765","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",1,2]]},"language":"en","page":"50-59","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Impact of intensive agricultural management on carbon and nitrogen dynamics in the humid tropics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00380768.2019.1705182","volume":"66"},

Consequences include impaired cognitive and physical development and increased childhood morbidity and mortality. Recent studies suggest that forests help alleviate micronutrient deficiency by increasing dietary diversity. However, evidence is mostly based on weakly designed local case studies of limited relevance to global policies. Furthermore, impacts of forests on diet vary among communities, and understanding this variation can help target actions to enhance impact. We compile data on children’s diets in over 43,000 households across 27 developing countries to examine the impacts of forests on dietary diversity. We use empirical designs that are attentive to assumptions necessary for causal interpretations and that adequately account for confounding factors that could mask or mimic the impact. We find that high exposure to forests causes children to have at least 25% greater dietary diversity compared to lack of exposure, a result comparable to the impacts of some nutrition-sensitive agricultural programs. A closer look at a subset of African countries indicates that impacts are generally higher for less developed communities, but highest with certain access to markets, roads, and education. Our results also indicate that forests could help reduce vitamin A and iron deficiencies. Our study establishes the causal relationship between forests and diet and thus strengthens the evidence for integrating forest conservation and management into nutrition interventions. Our results also suggest that providing households some access to capital can increase the impact of forest-related interventions on nutrition.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Rasolofoson","given":"Ranaivo A."},{"family":"Hanauer","given":"Merlin M."},{"family":"Pappinen","given":"Ari"},{"family":"Fisher","given":"Brendan"},{"family":"Ricketts","given":"Taylor H."}],"citation-key":"rasolofosonImpactsForestsChildren2018","container-title":"Science Advances","DOI":"10.1126/sciadv.aat2853","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",8,15]]},"page":"eaat2853","publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","source":"www-science-org.proxy3.library.mcgill.ca (Atypon)","title":"Impacts of forests on children’s diet in rural areas across 27 developing countries","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aat2853","volume":"4"},

However, our knowledge of FT from tropical regions is mostly derived from case studies from within a particular country, making it difficult to generalize findings across larger regions. Here we overcome these difficulties by conducting a recent (2001–2010) satellite-based analysis of trends in forest cover across Central America, stratified by biomes, which we related to socioeconomic variables associated with human development. Results show a net decrease of woody vegetation resulting from 12,201 km2 of deforestation of moist forests and 6,825 km2 of regrowth of conifer and dry forests. The Human Development Index was the socioeconomic variable best associated with forest cover change. The least-developed countries, Nicaragua and Guatemala, experienced both rapid deforestation of moist forests and significant recovery of conifer and dry forests. In contrast, the most developed countries, Panama and Costa Rica, had net woody vegetation gain and a more stable forest cover configuration. These results imply a good agreement with FT predictions of forest change in relation to socioeconomic development, but strong asymmetry in rates and directions of change largely dependent upon the biome where change is occurring. The FT model should be refined by incorporating ecological and socioeconomic heterogeneity, particularly in multicountry and regional studies. These asymmetric patterns of forest change should be evaluated when developing strategies for conserving biodiversity and environmental services.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Redo","given":"Daniel J."},{"family":"Grau","given":"H.

  {"id":"reesLongTermStudiesVegetation2001","abstract":"By integrating a wide range of experimental, comparative, and theoretical approaches, ecologists are starting to gain a detailed understanding of the long-term dynamics of vegetation. We explore how patterns of variation in demographic traits among species have provided insight into the processes that structure plant communities. We find a common set of mechanisms, derived from ecological and evolutionary principles, that underlie the main forces shaping systems as diverse as annual plant communities and tropical forests. Trait variation between species maintains diversity and has important implications for ecosystem processes. Hence, greater understanding of how Earth's vegetation functions will likely require integration of ecosystem science with ideas from plant evolutionary, population, and community ecology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Rees","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Condit","given":"Rick"},{"family":"Crawley","given":"Mick"},{"family":"Pacala","given":"Steve"},{"family":"Tilman","given":"Dave"}],"citation-key":"reesLongTermStudiesVegetation2001","container-title":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.1062586","issue":"5530","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001",7,27]]},"page":"650-655","publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","source":"www-science-org.proxy3.library.mcgill.ca (Atypon)","title":"Long-Term Studies of Vegetation Dynamics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1062586","volume":"293"},
  {"id":"reichertModelingCarbonCosts2023","abstract":"Plants growing in low phosphorus (P) soils, such as in the predominant soils of Amazonia, are believed to devote more energy to acquiring P through absorptive root production, symbionts, and root exudates than plants in more fertile soils. Accounting for these energy costs in vegetation models is essential, as underestimating carbon (C) allocation to nutrient acquisition may lead to overestimating plant biomass growth. We developed a quantitative model to test a theoretical framework of C costs of P acquisition across soil P gradients. The model considers four strategies: P foraging via absorptive roots and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and P mining via root exudation of phosphatases and organic acids. We used field observations (i.e., soil data, plant biomass production, and stoichiometry of different organs) from ten sites across Amazonia to calibrate the model and explore different scenarios of (i) experimental soil P addition and (ii) elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations (eCO2). Our model reproduced expected trends in P-acquisition strategies, with plants increasingly investing in foraging strategies as soil soluble inorganic P (Pi) increases and increasingly investing in mining strategies as total P and less available P forms decrease. Relative investment in P acquisition was within observed ranges. Plants, on average and across all sites, invested the equivalent of 20.5% of their estimated total net primary production (NPP) in P acquisition. On average, plants allocated 15.3% of their NPP to P acquisition in the three most fertile sites, compared to 29.0% in the least fertile sites. C allocation to arbuscular mycorrhizas, phosphatases, and organic acids, which are not commonly measured components of total NPP, was up to 25.8% (16.9% on average) of the total NPP. We highlight the need for quantitative data on plant C allocation to P acquisition from the soil to strengthen further model development and future model projections.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Reichert","given":"Tatiana"},{"family":"Rammig","given":"Anja"},{"family":"Papastefanou","given":"Phillip"},{"family":"Lugli","given":"Laynara F."},{"family":"Darela Filho","given":"João P."},{"family":"Gregor","given":"Konstantin"},{"family":"Fuchslueger","given":"Lucia"},{"family":"Quesada","given":"Carlos A."},{"family":"Fleischer","given":"Katrin"}],"citation-key":"reichertModelingCarbonCosts2023","container-title":"Ecological Modelling","container-title-short":"Ecological Modelling","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2023.110491","ISSN":"0304-3800","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,1]]},"page":"110491","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Modeling the carbon costs of plant phosphorus acquisition in Amazonian forests","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380023002211","volume":"485"},

Soils in vast areas of Amazonia are P-impoverished, and little is known about the variation or plasticity in plant P-use and -acquisition strategies across space and time, hampering the accuracy of projections in vegetation models. Here, we synthesize current knowledge of leaf P resorption, fine-root P foraging, arbuscular mycorrhizal symbioses, and root acid phosphatase and organic acid exudation and discuss how these strategies vary with soil P concentrations and in response to elevated atmospheric CO2. We identify knowledge gaps and suggest ways forward to fill those gaps. Additionally, we propose a conceptual framework for the variations in plant P-use and -acquisition strategies along soil P gradients of Amazonia. We suggest that in soils with intermediate to high P concentrations, at the plant community level, investments are primarily directed to P foraging strategies via roots and arbuscular mycorrhizas, whereas in soils with intermediate to low P concentrations, investments shift to prioritize leaf P resorption and mining strategies via phosphatases and organic acids.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Reichert","given":"Tatiana"},{"family":"Rammig","given":"Anja"},{"family":"Fuchslueger","given":"Lucia"},{"family":"Lugli","given":"Laynara F."},{"family":"Quesada","given":"Carlos A."},{"family":"Fleischer","given":"Katrin"}],"citation-key":"reichertPlantPhosphorususeAcquisition2022","container-title":"New Phytologist","DOI":"10.1111/nph.17985","ISSN":"1469-8137","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2022 The Authors.

  {"id":"reichWorldwideFastSlow2014","abstract":"The leaf economics spectrum (LES) provides a useful framework for examining species strategies as shaped by their evolutionary history. However, that spectrum, as originally described, involved only two key resources (carbon and nutrients) and one of three economically important plant organs. Herein, I evaluate whether the economics spectrum idea can be broadly extended to water – the third key resource –stems, roots and entire plants and to individual, community and ecosystem scales. My overarching hypothesis is that strong selection along trait trade-off axes, in tandem with biophysical constraints, results in convergence for any taxon on a uniformly fast, medium or slow strategy (i.e. rates of resource acquisition and processing) for all organs and all resources. Evidence for economic trait spectra exists for stems and roots as well as leaves, and for traits related to water as well as carbon and nutrients. These apply generally within and across scales (within and across communities, climate zones, biomes and lineages). There are linkages across organs and coupling among resources, resulting in an integrated whole-plant economics spectrum. Species capable of moving water rapidly have low tissue density, short tissue life span and high rates of resource acquisition and flux at organ and individual scales. The reverse is true for species with the slow strategy. Different traits may be important in different conditions, but as being fast in one respect generally requires being fast in others, being fast or slow is a general feature of species. Economic traits influence performance and fitness consistent with trait-based theory about underlying adaptive mechanisms. Traits help explain differences in growth and survival across resource gradients and thus help explain the distribution of species and the assembly of communities across light, water and nutrient gradients. Traits scale up – fast traits are associated with faster rates of ecosystem processes such as decomposition or primary productivity, and slow traits with slow process rates. Synthesis. Traits matter. A single ‘fast–slow’ plant economics spectrum that integrates across leaves, stems and roots is a key feature of the plant universe and helps to explain individual ecological strategies, community assembly processes and the functioning of ecosystems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Reich","given":"Peter B."}],"citation-key":"reichWorldwideFastSlow2014","container-title":"Journal of Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/1365-2745.12211","ISSN":"1365-2745","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2014 The Author.

Current manual forest carbon stock inventory methods of measuring single trees by hand are time, labour, and cost intensive and have been shown to be subjective. They can lead to substantial overestimation of the carbon stock and ultimately distrust in forest financing. The potential for impact and scale of leveraging advancements in machine learning and remote sensing technologies is promising, but needs to be of high quality in order to replace the current forest stock protocols for certifications. \n \n In this paper, we present ReforesTree, a benchmark dataset of forest carbon stock in six agro-forestry carbon offsetting sites in Ecuador. Furthermore, we show that a deep learning-based end-to-end model using individual tree detection from low cost RGB-only drone imagery is accurately estimating forest carbon stock within official carbon offsetting certification standards. Additionally, our baseline CNN model outperforms state-of-the-art satellite-based forest biomass and carbon stock estimates for this type of small-scale, tropical agro-forestry sites. We present this dataset to encourage machine learning research in this area to increase accountability and transparency of monitoring, verification and reporting (MVR) in carbon offsetting projects, as well as scaling global reforestation financing through accurate remote sensing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Reiersen","given":"Gyri"},{"family":"Dao","given":"David"},{"family":"Lütjens","given":"Björn"},{"family":"Klemmer","given":"Konstantin"},{"family":"Amara","given":"Kenza"},{"family":"Steinegger","given":"Attila"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Ce"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Xiaoxiang"}],"citation-key":"reiersenReforesTreeDatasetEstimating2022","container-title":"Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence","DOI":"10.1609/aaai.v36i11.21471","ISSN":"2374-3468","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,28]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright (c) 2022 Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence","number":"11","page":"12119-12125","source":"ojs.aaai.org","title":"ReforesTree: A Dataset for Estimating Tropical Forest Carbon Stock with Deep Learning and Aerial Imagery","title-short":"ReforesTree","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/21471","volume":"36"},
  {"id":"requenasuarezEstimatingAbovegroundNet2019","abstract":"As countries advance in greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting for climate change mitigation, consistent estimates of aboveground net biomass change (∆AGB) are needed. Countries with limited forest monitoring capabilities in the tropics and subtropics rely on IPCC 2006 default ∆AGB rates, which are values per ecological zone, per continent. Similarly, research into forest biomass change at a large scale also makes use of these rates. IPCC 2006 default rates come from a handful of studies, provide no uncertainty indications and do not distinguish between older secondary forests and old‐growth forests. As part of the 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, we incorporate ∆AGB data available from 2006 onwards, comprising 176 chronosequences in secondary forests and 536 permanent plots in old‐growth and managed/logged forests located in 42 countries in Africa, North and South America and Asia. We generated ∆AGB rate estimates for younger secondary forests (≤20 years), older secondary forests (>20 years and up to 100 years) and old‐growth forests, and accounted for uncertainties in our estimates. In tropical rainforests, for which data availability was the highest, our ∆AGB rate estimates ranged from 3.4 (Asia) to 7.6 (Africa) Mg ha−1 year−1 in younger secondary forests, from 2.3 (North and South America) to 3.5 (Africa) Mg ha−1 year−1 in older secondary forests, and 0.7 (Asia) to 1.3 (Africa) Mg ha−1 year−1 in old‐growth forests. We provide a rigorous and traceable refinement of the IPCC 2006 default rates in tropical and subtropical ecological zones, and identify which areas require more research on ∆AGB. In this respect, this study should be considered as an important step towards quantifying the role of tropical and subtropical forests as carbon sinks with higher accuracy; our new rates can be used for large‐scale GHG accounting by governmental bodies, nongovernmental organizations and in scientific research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Requena Suarez","given":"Daniela"},{"family":"Rozendaal","given":"Danaë M.

Therefore, there is a need to understand how carbon stocks of disturbed and recovering tropical forests are determined by environmental conditions and human use.

Plots were divided into recovering forests (areas recovering from deforestation for <25years) and established forests (areas consistently defined as forests for ⩾25 years). This division, as well as the detection of year of forest establishment, was obtained through the use of dense satellite time series of forest cover probability. In decreasing order of importance, AGB in recovering forests unexpectedly decreased with water availability, increased with surrounding tree cover and time since establishment, and decreased with elevation, distance to roads, and soil phosphorus content. AGB in established forests unexpectedly decreased with water availability, increased with surrounding tree cover, and soil nitrogen content, and decreased with elevation. AGB in recovering forests increased by 0.4 Mg ha−1 yr−1 during the first 20 years following establishment.

Here we tested the hypothesis that the time since land-use transition (age of frontier) and agricultural intensification also drive changes in the region’s fire regimes by reducing fire probability in both drought and non-drought years. We modeled fire probability as a function of the time since land-use transitions based on MapBiomas Project datasets from 1986 to 2020. We find that, while burned area declined as pasturelands aged and croplands advanced, deforestation abruptly increased fire activity before (Amazon: 4 years; Cerrado: 3 years) and after (Amazon: 8 years; Cerrado: 7 years) land clearing for pasture, especially in the Amazon. Additionally, the combination of ignition risk, drought, and air-dryness increased the likelihood of large extents of burned areas associated with deforestation. Incorporating frontier age as a proxy for governance in fire modeling is crucial, given the ecological implications of changing fire regimes despite declining rates of fire probability. Most importantly, protecting against deforestation and preserving native vegetation are vital. Areas burned by fire decrease as pastures age and cropland advances, but fire activity increases before and after conversion of forests to pastures via deforestation in the Amazon-Cerrado region, according to an analysis of remotely-sensed data over the period 1986–2020.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Ribeiro","given":"Andreia F.

For spatial correlations, biodiversity relates more strongly to measures of ES supply than to resulting human benefits. For management comparisons, biodiversity of ‘service providers’ predicts ES more often than biodiversity of functionally unrelated taxa, but the opposite is true for spatial correlations. Functional experiments occur at smaller spatial scales than management and spatial studies, which show contrasting responses to scale.

The answer hinges on characterizing the value of nature, a tricky business from biophysical, socioeconomic, and ethical perspectives. Although the societal benefits of native ecosystems are clearly immense, they remain largely unquantified for all but a few services. Here, we estimate the value of tropical forest in supplying pollination services to agriculture. We focus on coffee because it is one of the world's most valuable export commodities and is grown in many of the world's most biodiverse regions. Using pollination experiments along replicated distance gradients, we found that forest-based pollinators increased coffee yields by 20% within ≈1 km of forest. Pollination also improved coffee quality near forest by reducing the frequency of “peaberries” (i.e., small misshapen seeds) by 27%. During 2000–2003, pollination services from two forest fragments (46 and 111 hectares) translated into ≈$60,000 (U.S.) per year for one Costa Rican farm.

Many assume that among the most important of these are the particular bundles of rights regulating who can benefit from land (tenure form) and the overall assurance that those rights will be upheld (tenure security). This paper reviews literature that connects forest outcomes and land tenure to better understand broad interactions between tenure form, security and forest change. Papers from economic theory suggest tenure is embedded in a broader socioeconomic context, with the potential for either a positive or negative conservation impact on forested land. Empirically, we find 36 publications that link land cover change to tenure conditions while also controlling for other plausibly confounding variables. Publications often investigate more than one site and more than one form of tenure, so from these we derive 118 cases linking forest change with a specific tenure form in a particular location. From these cases, we find evidence that protected areas are associated with positive forest outcomes and that land tenure security is associated with less deforestation, regardless of the form of tenure. We conclude with a call for more robust identification of this relationship in future research, as well as set of recommendations for policymakers, particularly as forest carbon incentive programs such as REDD integrate further into national policies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Robinson","given":"Brian E."},{"family":"Holland","given":"Margaret B."},{"family":"Naughton-Treves","given":"Lisa"}],"citation-key":"robinsonDoesSecureLand2014","container-title":"Global Environmental Change","container-title-short":"Global Environmental Change","DOI":"10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2013.05.012","ISSN":"0959-3780","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",11,1]]},"page":"281-293","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Does secure land tenure save forests?

The criteria and approach we propose, for a paradigm shift towards sustainable intensification of agriculture, integrates the dual and interdependent goals of using sustainable practices to meet rising human needs while contributing to resilience and sustainability of landscapes, the biosphere, and the Earth system. Both of these, in turn, are required to sustain the future viability of agriculture.

High-resolution remote sensing techniques, e.g., spaceborne lidar, can measure complex tropical forest structures, but it remains a challenge how to interpret such information for the assessment of forest biomass and productivity. Here, we develop an approach to estimate basal area, aboveground biomass and productivity within Amazonia by matching 770,000 GLAS lidar (ICESat) profiles with forest simulations considering spatial heterogeneous environmental and ecological conditions. This allows for deriving frequency distributions of key forest attributes for the entire Amazon. This detailed interpretation of remote sensing data improves estimates of forest attributes by 20–43% as compared to (conventional) estimates using mean canopy height. The inclusion of forest modeling has a high potential to close a missing link between remote sensing measurements and the 3D structure of forests, and may thereby improve continent-wide estimates of biomass and productivity., Improving estimates of forest biomass based on remote sensing data is important to assess global carbon cycling.

  {"id":"rodriguezAmericanTrypanosomiasisChagas2017","abstract":"American trypanosomiasis, or Chagas disease, is a growing public health problem in Panama, and further forest degradation due to human population growth is expected to worsen the situation. Most people infected with the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi are silently ill, and their life expectancy is severely compromised, which contributes to further deterioration of living conditions in endemic regions. Here, we review the outcomes of nearly 100 years of ecological and epidemiological investigation about Chagas disease in Panama, in an attempt to highlight progress, identify needs, and re-orient future efforts. Rhodnius pallescens and Triatoma dimidiata are both primary vectors of T. cruzi in Panama, but R. pallescens seems more efficient in human-altered forest ecosystems due to a greater degree of association with Attalea butyracea. In contrast, T. dimidiata transmits T. cruzi efficiently under more sylvatic conditions (e.g. settlements inside old-growth or secondary forest patches), where its populations reach considerable numbers irrespective of the absence of A. butyracea. A trend of increasing forest degradation, suburbanization, and development of tourism in Panama favoring the establishment of A. butyracea and other palm tree species (Acrocomia sp.) suggests that a colonist species like R. pallescens will continue to play a more prominent role in the transmission of T. cruzi than a forest specialist like T. dimidiata. However, studies about the taxonomic status and ecology of these vectors are still needed in Panama to address their transmission potential fully. The implementation of an active surveillance system and education programs could greatly minimize the risk of Chagas disease transmission in Panama, preventing fatal infections in children from endemic areas.","author":[{"family":"Rodriguez","given":"Indra G."},{"family":"Loaiza","given":"Jose R."}],"citation-key":"rodriguezAmericanTrypanosomiasisChagas2017","container-title":"Parasit.

  {"id":"rosenfieldEcologicalIntegrityTropical2023","abstract":"ABSTRACT\n            Naturally regenerating forests or secondary forests (SFs) are a promising strategy for restoring large expanses of tropical forests at low cost and with high environmental benefits. This expectation is supported by the high resilience of tropical forests after natural disturbances, yet this resilience can be severely reduced by human impacts. Assessing the characteristics of SFs and their ecological integrity (EI) is essential to evaluating their role for conservation, restoration, and provisioning of ecosystem services. In this study, we aim to propose a concept and indicators that allow the assessment and classification of the EI of SFs. To this end, we review the literature to assess how EI has been addressed in different ecosystems and which indicators of EI are most commonly used for tropical forests. Building upon this knowledge we propose a modification of the concept of EI to embrace SFs and suggest indicators of EI that can be applied to different successional stages or stand ages. Additionally, we relate these indicators to ecosystem service provision in order to support the practical application of the theory. EI is generally defined as the ability of ecosystems to support and maintain composition, structure and function similar to the reference conditions of an undisturbed ecosystem. This definition does not consider the temporal dynamics of recovering ecosystems, such as SFs. Therefore, we suggest incorporation of an optimal successional trajectory as a reference in addition to the old‐growth forest reference. The optimal successional trajectory represents the maximum EI that can be attained at each successional stage in a given region and enables the evaluation of EI at any given age class. We further suggest a list of indicators, the main ones being: compositional indicators (species diversity/richness and indicator species); structural indicators (basal area, heterogeneity of basal area and canopy cover); function indicators (tree growth and mortality); and landscape proxies (landscape heterogeneity, landscape connectivity). Finally, we discuss how this approach can assist in defining the value of SF patches to provide ecosystem services, restore forests and contribute to ecosystem conservation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Rosenfield","given":"Milena F."},{"family":"Jakovac","given":"Catarina C."},{"family":"Vieira","given":"Daniel L.

Secondary forests recover remarkably fast in species richness but slowly in species composition.

  {"id":"rozendaalCompetitionInfluencesTree2020","abstract":"Competition among trees is an important driver of community structure and dynamics in tropical forests. Neighboring trees may impact an individual tree’s growth rate and probability of mortality, but large-scale geographic and environmental variation in these competitive effects has yet to be evaluated across the tropical forest biome. We quantified effects of competition on tree-level basal area growth and mortality for trees ≥10-cm diameter across 151 ~1-ha plots in mature tropical forests in Amazonia and tropical Africa by developing nonlinear models that accounted for wood density, tree size, and neighborhood crowding. Using these models, we assessed how water availability (i.e., climatic water deficit) and soil fertility influenced the predicted plot-level strength of competition (i.e., the extent to which growth is reduced, or mortality is increased, by competition across all individual trees). On both continents, tree basal area growth decreased with wood density and increased with tree size. Growth decreased with neighborhood crowding, which suggests that competition is important. Tree mortality decreased with wood density and generally increased with tree size, but was apparently unaffected by neighborhood crowding. Across plots, variation in the plot-level strength of competition was most strongly related to plot basal area (i.e., the sum of the basal area of all trees in a plot), with greater reductions in growth occurring in forests with high basal area, but in Amazonia, the strength of competition also varied with plot-level wood density. In Amazonia, the strength of competition increased with water availability because of the greater basal area of wetter forests, but was only weakly related to soil fertility. In Africa, competition was weakly related to soil fertility and invariant across the shorter water availability gradient. Overall, our results suggest that competition influences the structure and dynamics of tropical forests primarily through effects on individual tree growth rather than mortality and that the strength of competition largely depends on environment-mediated variation in basal area.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Rozendaal","given":"Danaë M.

  {"id":"rozendaalDemographicDriversTree2015","abstract":"Second-growth tropical forests are an important global carbon sink. As current knowledge on biomass accumulation during secondary succession is heavily based on chronosequence studies, direct estimates of annual rates of biomass accumulation in monitored stands are largely unavailable. We evaluated the contributions of tree diameter increment, recruitment, and mortality to annual tree biomass change during succession for three groups of tree species: Second-growth (SG) specialists, generalists, and old-growth (OG) specialists. We monitored six second-growth tropical forests that varied in stand age and two old-growth forests in northeastern Costa Rica. We monitored these over a period of 8 to 16 years. To assess rates of biomass change during secondary succession, we compared standing biomass and biomass dynamics between second-growth forest stages and old-growth forest, and evaluated the effect of stand age on standing biomass and biomass dynamics in secondgrowth forests. Standing tree biomass increased with stand age during succession, whereas the rate of biomass change decreased. Biomass change was largely driven by tree diameter increment and mortality, with a minor contribution from recruitment. The relative importance of these demographic drivers shifted over succession. Biomass gain due to tree diameter increment decreased with stand age, whereas biomass loss due to mortality increased. In the age range of our second-growth forests, 10-41 years, SG specialists dominated tree biomass in secondgrowth forests. SG specialists, and to a lesser extent generalists, also dominated stand-level biomass increase due to tree diameter increment, whereas SG specialists largely accounted for decreases in biomass due to mortality. Our results indicate that tree growth is largely driving biomass dynamics early in succession, whereas both growth and mortality are important later in succession. Biomass dynamics are largely accounted for by a few SG specialists and one generalist species, Pentaclethra macroloba. To assess the generality of our results, similar long-term studies should be compared across tropical forest landscapes.","author":[{"family":"Rozendaal","given":"Danae M.

  {"id":"ruehrEvidenceAttributionEnhanced2023","abstract":"Climate change has been partially mitigated by an increasing net land carbon sink in the terrestrial biosphere; understanding the processes that drive this sink is thus essential for protecting, managing and projecting this important ecosystem service. In this Review, we examine evidence for an enhanced land carbon sink and attribute the observed response to drivers and processes. This sink has doubled from 1.2 ± 0.5 PgC yr−1 in the 1960s to 3.1 ± 0.6 PgC yr−1 in the 2010s. This trend results largely from carbon dioxide fertilization increasing photosynthesis (driving an increase in the annual land carbon sink of >2 PgC globally since 1900), mainly in tropical forest regions, and elevated temperatures reducing cold limitation, mainly at higher latitudes. Continued long-term land carbon sequestration is possible through the end of this century under multiple emissions scenarios, especially if nature-based climate solutions and appropriate ecosystem management are used. A new generation of globally distributed field experiments is needed to improve understanding of future carbon sink potential by measuring belowground carbon release, the response to carbon dioxide enrichment, and long-term shifts in carbon allocation and turnover.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Ruehr","given":"Sophie"},{"family":"Keenan","given":"Trevor F."},{"family":"Williams","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Yu"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Xinchen"},{"family":"Bastos","given":"Ana"},{"family":"Canadell","given":"Josep G."},{"family":"Prentice","given":"Iain Colin"},{"family":"Sitch","given":"Stephen"},{"family":"Terrer","given":"César"}],"citation-key":"ruehrEvidenceAttributionEnhanced2023","container-title":"Nature Reviews Earth & Environment","container-title-short":"Nat Rev Earth Environ","DOI":"10.1038/s43017-023-00456-3","ISSN":"2662-138X","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",8]]},"language":"en","license":"2023 Springer Nature Limited","number":"8","page":"518-534","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www-nature-com.proxy3.library.mcgill.ca","title":"Evidence and attribution of the enhanced land carbon sink","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-023-00456-3","volume":"4"},

They developed a forest model that allows for objective predictions of tropical forest dynamics and validated the model's predictions against independent data.

Here, we examine the role of tree diversity and functional traits in determining carbon storage in a mixed-species plantation and in a natural tropical forest in Panama.

Then we compared the species ranking based on wood density, maximum diameter, maximum height, and leaf mass per area (LMA) between sites to reveal how these values changed between different forests. Increased species richness, a higher proportion of nitrogen fixers and species with low LMA increased carbon storage in the mixed-species plantation, while a higher proportion of large trees and species with high LMA increased tree carbon storage in the natural forest. Furthermore, we found that tree species varied greatly in their absolute and relative values between study sites.

We examined the relative importance of environment, space, and diversity on ecosystem function, speciﬁcally tree carbon storage in four plant types (understory/canopy; trees/palms), in a tropical forest in central Panama. The objectives of this study were to detect the relationship between tree diversity and carbon storage given the environmental and spatial variation that occur in natural forests and to determine which species diversity measure is more important to tree carbon storage: richness or dominance. We used redundancy analyses to partition the effect of these sources of variation on tree carbon storage. We showed that together, environment, space, and diversity accounted for 43 percent of tree carbon storage, where diversity (19%) alone is the most important source of variation and explained more variation than space (13%) and environment (1%) together. Therefore, even in natural forests where substantial environment and spatial variation can be found, it is still possible to detect the effect of diversity on ecosystem function at scales relevant to conservation. Moreover, both richness and dominance are important to explain the variation on tree carbon storage in natural forests suggesting that these two diversity measures are complementary. Thus, tree diversity is important to predict tree carbon storage in hyperdiverse forests.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Ruiz-Jaen","given":"Maria C."},{"family":"Potvin","given":"Catherine"}],"citation-key":"ruiz-jaenTreeDiversityExplains2010","container-title":"Biotropica","DOI":"10.1111/j.1744-7429.2010.00631.x","ISSN":"00063606","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",11]]},"language":"en","page":"638-646","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Tree Diversity Explains Variation in Ecosystem Function in a Neotropical Forest in Panama: Diversity Effects in Tropical Forests","title-short":"Tree Diversity Explains Variation in Ecosystem Function in a Neotropical Forest in Panama","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1744-7429.2010.00631.x","volume":"42"},

In a long-term, randomized complete block experiment in which climate, soil type, and previous land-use history were similar, we evaluated effects of individual native tropical tree species on water-stable macroaggregate size distributions in an Oxisol. We conducted this study at La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica, in six vegetation types: 25-year-old plantations of four tree species grown in monodominant stands; an unplanted Control; and an adjacent mature forest. Tree species signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced aggregate proportions in smaller size classes (0.25–1.0 mm), which were correlated with ﬁne-root growth and litterfall. Tree species altered soil pH differentially. Across all vegetation types, the proportion of smaller macroaggregates declined signiﬁcantly as soil pH increased (p ≤ 0.0184).

Here we present a “benchmark” map of biomass carbon stocks over 2.5 billion ha of forests on three continents, encompassing all tropical forests, for the early 2000s, which will be invaluable for REDD assessments at both project and national scales. We mapped the total carbon stock in live biomass (above- and belowground), using a combination of data from 4,079 in situ inventory plots and satellite light detection and ranging (Lidar) samples of forest structure to estimate carbon storage, plus optical and microwave imagery (1-km resolution) to extrapolate over the landscape. The total biomass carbon stock of forests in the study region is estimated to be 247 Gt C, with 193 Gt C stored aboveground and 54 Gt C stored belowground in roots. Forests in Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia accounted for 49%, 25%, and 26% of the total stock, respectively. By analyzing the errors propagated through the estimation process, uncertainty at the pixel level (100 ha) ranged from ±6% to ±53%, but was constrained at the typical project (10,000 ha) and national (>1,000,000 ha) scales at\n              ca\n              . ±5% and\n              ca\n              . ±1%, respectively.

We used distribution modelling to identify climate change refugia for 617 terrestrial mammals and to quantify the role of protected areas (PAs) in providing refugia across South America. To do so, we compared species potential distribution across different scenarios of climate change, highlighting those regions likely to retain suitable climatic conditions by year 2090, and explored the proportion of refugia inside PAs. Moist tropical forests in high-elevation areas with complex topography concentrated the highest local diversity of species refugia, although regionally important refugia centers occurred elsewhere. Andean–Amazon forests contained climate change refugia for more than half of the continental species’ pool and for up to 87 species locally (17 × 17 km2 grid cell). The highlands of the southern Atlantic Forest also included megadiverse refugia for up to 76 species per cell. Almost half of the species that may ﬁnd refugia in the Atlantic Forest will do so in a single region—the Serra do Mar and Serra do Espinhaço. Most of the refugia we identiﬁed, however, were not in PAs, which may contain <6% of the total area of climate change refugia, leaving 129–237 species with no refugia inside the territorial limits of PAs of any kind. Our results reveal a dismal scenario for the level of refugia protection in some of the most biodiverse regions of the world.

  {"id":"salisburyDoesTreeSpecies2015","abstract":"With growing pressure on primary forests from destructive land uses, increasing the diversity of native species plantations can increase ecosystem service provision, such as timber production or carbon sequestration, thus better supporting sustainable livelihoods. Understanding the effects of tree species composition on productivity can inform plantation design and ecological restoration strategies. However, tree species composition effects have been neglected in experimental biodiversity-ecosystem function (BEF) research. This study uses a 10-yr data set from one of the first tropical planted forest experiments established with native species and designed for BEF research at scales relevant to forest management. At our site in Sardinilla, Panama, we established plots containing 6 species from a pool of 18, in four combinations, to investigate how composition affects species and plot productivity. We used basal area as a proxy for productivity through time, measured annually, and summed this at species and plot levels for analysis. We found that plots that differed in species composition appeared to differ in temporal rate of basal area increase, but did not differ in BA after 10 yr. Species were generally consistent in size between compositions, and composition performance was correlated with the size of component species, suggesting that species identities were most important in determining plot productivity. Our results suggest that species choice can be based on preferences for individual species, as species performance was consistent across composition contexts. We make recommendations for the use of particularly productive species that also provide multiple services such as Guazuma ulmifolia, Spondias mombin, and Anacardium excelsum.","author":[{"family":"Salisbury","given":"Claire L."},{"family":"Potvin","given":"Catherine"}],"citation-key":"salisburyDoesTreeSpecies2015","container-title":"Biotropica","DOI":"10.1111/BTP.12252","ISSN":"0006-3606","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",9,1]]},"page":"559-568","title":"Does Tree Species Composition Affect Productivity in a Tropical Planted Forest?","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/BTP.12252","volume":"47"},

  {"id":"sanseveroLanduseEcologicalResilience2017","abstract":"The ecological resilience of abandoned pastures has important implications for the potential of passive restoration in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, especially in the face of the ambitious restoration targets for this biodiversity hotspot. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the inﬂuence of past land-use on natural regeneration in two secondary forests that established on abandoned pastures with different land use histories (Abandoned ? Fire—15 years since the last ﬁre event and Abandoned—36 years ago) in a lowland Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Both secondary forests exhibit low resilience for the three analyzed attributes: vegetation structure, richness, and species composition. Secondary forests affected by ﬁre have the lowest values for species richness, aboveground biomass and leaf area index compared to old-growth forests. Secondary forests were dominated by Moquiniastrum polymorphum—Asteraceae, which was absent from the oldgrowth forests. Fire resistance, capacity to establish in nutrient-poor soils and efﬁcient seed dispersal in human-modiﬁed landscapes are important attributes that may explain the dominance of this species. We demonstrate that even in sites considered appropriate for passive restoration a priori (e.g. located in a protected area, 36 years since abandonment and close to old-growth forests), secondary forests exhibited low aboveground biomass and communities were dominated by few species. Therefore, our results highlight the effects of past land-use on natural regeneration and suggest the necessity to use interventions such as enrichment plantings, nucleation techniques and assisted natural regeneration in order to accelerate forest restoration.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Sansevero","given":"Jerônimo Boelsums Barreto"},{"family":"Prieto","given":"Pablo Viany"},{"family":"Sánchez-Tapia","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Braga","given":"João Marcelo Alvarenga"},{"family":"Rodrigues","given":"Pablo José Francisco Pena"}],"citation-key":"sanseveroLanduseEcologicalResilience2017","container-title":"New Forests","container-title-short":"New Forests","DOI":"10.1007/s11056-017-9586-4","ISSN":"0169-4286, 1573-5095","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",9]]},"language":"en","page":"573-586","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Past land-use and ecological resilience in a lowland Brazilian Atlantic Forest: implications for passive restoration","title-short":"Past land-use and ecological resilience in a lowland Brazilian Atlantic Forest","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11056-017-9586-4","volume":"48"},
  {"id":"santoroESABiomassClimate2023","abstract":"This dataset comprises estimates of forest above-ground biomass for the years 2010, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020. They are derived from a combination of Earth observation data, depending on the year, from the Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission, Envisat’s ASAR instrument and JAXA’s Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS-1 and ALOS-2), along with additional information from Earth observation sources. The data has been produced as part of the European Space Agency's (ESA's) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) programme by the Biomass CCI team. This release of the data is version 4. Compared to version 3, version 4 consists of an update of the three maps of AGB for the years 2010, 2017 and 2018 and new AGB maps for 2019 and 2020. New AGB change maps have been created for consecutive years (2018-2017, 2019-2018 and 2020-2019) and for a decadal interval (2020-2010). The pool of remote sensing data now includes multi-temporal observations at L-band for all biomes and for all years. The AGB maps rely on revised allometries which are now based on a longer record of spaceborne LiDAR data from the GEDI and ICESat-2 missions. Temporal information is now implemented in the retrieval algorithm to preserve biomass dynamics as expressed in the remote sensing data. Biases between 2010 and more recent years have been reduced. The data products consist of two (2) global layers that include estimates of: 1) above ground biomass (AGB, unit: tons/ha i.e., Mg/ha) (raster dataset). This is defined as the mass, expressed as oven-dry weight of the woody parts (stem, bark, branches and twigs) of all living trees excluding stump and roots 2) per-pixel estimates of above-ground biomass uncertainty expressed as the standard deviation in Mg/ha (raster dataset) In addition, files describing the AGB change between two consecutive years (i.e., 2018-2017, 2019-2018 and 2020-2010) and over a decade (2020-2010) are provided (labelled as 2018_2017, 2019_2018, 2020_2019 and 2020_2010). Each AGB change product consists of two sets of maps: the standard deviation of the AGB change and a quality flag of the AGB change. Note that the change itself can be simply computed as the difference between two AGB maps, so is not provided directly. Data are provided in both netcdf and geotiff format.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Santoro","given":"Maurizio"},{"family":"Cartus","given":"Oliver"}],"citation-key":"santoroESABiomassClimate2023","contributor":[{"literal":"NERC EDS Centre For Environmental Data Analysis"},{"literal":"NERC EDS Centre For Environmental Data Analysis"},{"literal":"NERC EDS Centre For Environmental Data Analysis"},{"literal":"NERC EDS Centre For Environmental Data Analysis"},{"literal":"NERC EDS Centre For Environmental Data Analysis"},{"literal":"NERC EDS Centre For Environmental Data Analysis"}],"DOI":"10.5285/AF60720C1E404A9E9D2C145D2B2EAD4E","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en","license":"Use of these data is covered by the following licence: http://artefacts.ceda.ac.uk/licences/specific_licences/esacci_biomass_terms_and_conditions.pdf .

  {"id":"santoroResearchPathwaysForest2018","abstract":"Estimation of forest biomass with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and interferometric SAR (InSAR) observables has been surveyed in 186 peer-reviewed papers to identify major research pathways in terms of data used and retrieval models. Research evaluated primarily (i) L-band observations of SAR backscatter; and, (ii) single-image or multi-polarized retrieval schemes. The use of multi-temporal or multi-frequency data improved the biomass estimates when compared to single-image retrieval. Low frequency SAR backscatter contributed the most to the biomass estimates. Single-pass InSAR height was reported to be a more reliable predictor of biomass, overcoming the loss of sensitivity of SAR backscatter and coherence in high biomass forest. A variety of empirical and semi-empirical regression models relating biomass to the SAR observables were proposed. Semi-empirical models were mostly used for large-scale mapping because of the simple formulation and the robustness of the model parameters estimates to forest structure and environmental conditions. Non-parametric models were appraised for their capability to ingest multiple observations and perform accurate retrievals having a large number of training samples available. Some studies argued that estimating compartment biomass (in stems, branches, foliage) with different types of SAR observations would lead to an improved estimate of total biomass. Although promising, scientiﬁc evidence for such an assumption is still weak. The increased availability of free and open SAR observations from currently orbiting and forthcoming spaceborne SAR missions will foster studies on forest biomass retrieval. Approaches attempting to maximize the information content on biomass of individual data streams shall be pursued.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Santoro","given":"Maurizio"},{"family":"Cartus","given":"Oliver"}],"citation-key":"santoroResearchPathwaysForest2018","container-title":"Remote Sensing","container-title-short":"Remote Sensing","DOI":"10.3390/rs10040608","ISSN":"2072-4292","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",4,14]]},"language":"en","page":"608","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Research Pathways of Forest Above-Ground Biomass Estimation Based on SAR Backscatter and Interferometric SAR Observations","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/10/4/608","volume":"10"},

This species was first identified on Madeira Island in 2005, and between 2012 and 2013 was responsible for an outbreak of dengue that affected several thousand people. However, the potential distribution of the species on the island remains poorly investigated. Here we assess the suitability of current and future climatic conditions to the species on the island and complement this assessment with estimates of the suitability of land use and human settlement conditions. We used four modelling algorithms (boosted regression trees, generalized additive models, generalized linear models and random forest) and data on the distribution of the species worldwide and across the island. For both climatic and non-climatic factors, suitability estimates predicted the current distribution of the species with good accuracy (mean area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve = 0.88 ±0.06, mean true skill statistic = 0.72 ±0.1). Minimum temperature of coldest month was the most influential climatic predictor, while human population density, residential housing density and public spaces were the most influential predictors describing land use and human settlement conditions. Suitable areas under current climates are predicted to occur mainly in the warmer and densely inhabited coastal areas of the southern part of the island, where the species is already established. By mid-century (2041–2060), the extent of climatically suitable areas is expected to increase, mainly towards higher altitudes and in the eastern part of the island.

In particular, Aedes ægypti (Linnaeus) is the main vector for Chikungunya, Dengue, and Zika viruses in Latin America and it represents a global threat. Public health policies that aim at combating this vector require dependable and timely information, which is usually expensive to obtain with ﬁeld campaigns. For this reason, several eﬀorts have been done to use remote sensing due to its reduced cost. The present work includes the temporal modeling of the oviposition activity (measured weekly on 50 ovitraps in a north Argentinean city) of Aedes ægypti (Linnaeus), based on time series of data extracted from operational earth observation satellite images. We use are NDVI, NDWI, LST night, LST day and TRMM-GPM rain from 2012 to 2016 as predictive variables. In contrast to previous works which use linear models, we employ Machine Learning techniques using completely accessible open source toolkits. These models have the advantages of being non-parametric and capable of describing nonlinear relationships between variables. Speciﬁcally, in addition to two linear approaches, we assess a support vector machine, an artiﬁcial neural networks, a K-nearest neighbors and a decision tree regressor. Considerations are made on parameter tuning and the validation and training approach. The results are compared to linear models used in previous works with similar data sets for generating temporal predictive models. These new tools perform better than linear approaches, in particular nearest neighbor regression (KNNR) performs the best. These results provide better alternatives to be implemented operatively on the Argentine geospatial risk system that is running since 2012.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Scavuzzo","given":"Juan M."},{"family":"Trucco","given":"Francisco"},{"family":"Espinosa","given":"Manuel"},{"family":"Tauro","given":"Carolina B."},{"family":"Abril","given":"Marcelo"},{"family":"Scavuzzo","given":"Carlos M."},{"family":"Frery","given":"Alejandro C."}],"citation-key":"scavuzzoModelingDengueVector2018","container-title":"Acta Tropica","container-title-short":"Acta Tropica","DOI":"10.1016/j.actatropica.2018.05.003","ISSN":"0001706X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",9]]},"language":"en","page":"167-175","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Modeling Dengue vector population using remotely sensed data and machine learning","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0001706X17312111","volume":"185"},

A total of 24 plots (2025 m2) were established in 2001 using six native tree species, with 1-, 3-, and 6-species mixtures. We estimated litter production during the dry season 2005 with litter traps; decomposition was assessed with a litter bag approach during the following wet season. Litter production during the course of the dry season was highly variable among the tree species. Tree diversity significantly affected litter production, and the majority of the intermediate diverse mixtures had higher litter yields than expected based on yields in monoculture. In contrast, high diverse mixtures did not show such overyielding in litter production. Litter decomposition rates were also highly species-specific, and were related to various measures of litter quality (C/N, lignin/N, fibre content). We found no overall effect of litter diversity if the entire litter mixtures were analyzed, i.e. mixing species resulted in pure additive effects and observed decomposition rates were not different from expected rates. However, the individual species changed their decomposition pattern depending on the diversity of the litter mixture, i.e. there were species-specific responses to mixing litter. The analysis of temporal C and N dynamics within litter mixtures gave only limited evidence for nutrient transfer among litters of different quality. At this early stage of our tree diversity experiment, there are no coherent and general effects of tree species richness on both litter production and decomposition. Within the scope of the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationship, our results therefore highlight the process-specific effects diversity may have. Additionally, species-specific effects on ecosystem processes and their temporal dynamics are important, but such effects may change along the gradient of tree diversity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Scherer-Lorenzen","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Luis Bonilla","given":"José"},{"family":"Potvin","given":"Catherine"}],"citation-key":"scherer-lorenzenTreeSpeciesRichness2007","container-title":"Oikos","DOI":"10.1111/j.2007.0030-1299.16065.x","ISSN":"1600-0706","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007"]]},"language":"en","page":"2108-2124","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Tree species richness affects litter production and decomposition rates in a tropical biodiversity experiment","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.2007.0030-1299.16065.x","volume":"116"},

However, most studies concerning tree diversity and ecosystem functioning relationships use data from forest inventories (under noncontrolled conditions) or from very young plantation experiments. Here, we investigated temporal dynamics of diversity–productivity relationships and diversity–stability relationships in the oldest tropical tree diversity experiment. Sardinilla was established in Panama in 2001, with 22 plots that form a gradient in native tree species richness of one-, two-, three- and five-species communities. Using annual data describing tree diameters and heights, we calculated basal area increment as the proxy of tree productivity. We combined tree neighbourhood- and community-level analyses and tested the effects of both species diversity and structural diversity on productivity and its temporal stability. General patterns were consistent across both scales indicating that tree–tree interactions in neighbourhoods drive observed diversity effects. From 2006 to 2016, mean overyielding (higher productivity in mixtures than in monocultures) was 25%–30% in two- and three-species mixtures and 50% in five-species stands. Tree neighbourhood diversity enhanced community productivity but the effect of species diversity was stronger and increased over time, whereas the effect of structural diversity declined. Temporal stability of community productivity increased with species diversity via two principle mechanisms: asynchronous responses of species to environmental variability and overyielding. Overyielding in mixtures was highest during a strong El Niño-related drought. Overall, positive diversity–productivity and diversity–stability relationships predominated, with the highest productivity and stability at the highest levels of diversity. These results provide new insights into mixing effects in diverse, tropical plantations and highlight the importance of analyses of temporal dynamics for our understanding of the complex relationships between diversity, productivity and stability. Under climate change, mixed-species forests may provide both high levels and high stability of production.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Schnabel","given":"Florian"},{"family":"Schwarz","given":"Julia A."},{"family":"Dănescu","given":"Adrian"},{"family":"Fichtner","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Nock","given":"Charles A."},{"family":"Bauhus","given":"Jürgen"},{"family":"Potvin","given":"Catherine"}],"citation-key":"schnabelDriversProductivityIts2019","container-title":"Global Change Biology","DOI":"10.1111/gcb.14792","ISSN":"1365-2486","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2019 The Authors.

Lianas permeate most lowland tropical forests, where they can have a huge effect on tree diversity, recruitment, growth and survival, which, in turn, can alter tree community composition, carbon storage and carbon, nutrient and water fluxes. Consequently, increasing liana abundance and biomass have potentially profound ramifications for tropical forest composition and functioning. Currently, eight studies support the pattern of increasing liana abundance and biomass in American tropical and subtropical forests, whereas two studies, both from Africa, do not. The putative mechanisms to explain increasing lianas include increasing evapotranspirative demand, increasing forest disturbance and turnover, changes in land use and fragmentation and elevated atmospheric CO₂. Each of these mechanisms probably contributes to the observed patterns of increasing liana abundance and biomass, and the mechanisms are likely to be interrelated and synergistic. To determine whether liana increases are occurring throughout the tropics and to determine the mechanisms responsible for the observed patterns, a widespread network of large-scale, long-term monitoring plots combined with observational and manipulative studies that more directly investigate the putative mechanisms are essential.","author":[{"family":"Schnitzer","given":"Stefan A."},{"family":"Bongers","given":"Frans"}],"citation-key":"schnitzerIncreasingLianaAbundance2011","container-title":"Ecol.

We conducted quantitative, spatial analysis using ArcGIS and multivariate statistics from numerical ecology on land cover data from participatory maps, and household level socio-economic data from semi-structured interviews and surveys. Results illustrate that the Resource System’s topography and Actors’ socioeconomics, namely number of people at home and household land ownership, are constraining variables on land cover and help explain divergent forest cover. To reconstruct the influence of history and Governance Structure on the landscapes, we conducted qualitative data collection, namely participatory pebble scoring of historical land cover, interviews with key informants, an archival search, and creation of a participatory historical timeline. Historical governmental timber extraction in the region pre-settlement, guided by topography constraints, may have led to degraded Resource Units (forests) susceptible to clearing. The Governance Structure’s self-organizing, monitoring and networking activities with outside institutions in scientific projects, enabled by Actors’ leadership and social capital, likely encouraged forest conservation in the forest-rich territory. Future land management could therefore benefit from establishment of a local non-governmental organisation to coordinate a communal vision of management and harness external conservation resources. Our findings suggest that inputting both qualitative and quantitative data obtained by participatory methods into Ostrom’s framework can help diagnose territories with divergent landscapes, and thereby inform both forest conservation science and local land management.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Sharma","given":"Divya"},{"family":"Holmes","given":"Ignacia"},{"family":"Vergara-Asenjo","given":"Gerardo"},{"family":"Miller","given":"William N."},{"family":"Cunampio","given":"Mitzy"},{"family":"B.

  {"id":"shinbrotNaturalFinancialImpacts2022","abstract":"To counteract undesirable impacts of climate change, several different mitigation instruments have been proposed to sequester carbon through reforestation or avert greenhouse gas emissions due to land use change through forest carbon offset projects. Such projects will require an explicit focus on equitable benefit sharing to generate sustainable and alternative livelihoods. However, research on the impacts of forest carbon offset projects for individuals and communities has often been conducted without baseline data or counterfactuals built into the research methods. We conducted a study in a small Indigenous community in eastern Panama with participants and non-participants in a forest carbon offset project, across wealth groups. In this mixed methods study, participants and non-participants completed surveys before, during, and after implementation over 14 years to assess changes to natural and financial assets. We also assessed major concerns and perceived benefits of the carbon offset project via open-ended questions. Quantitative data show that participants continued to engage in reforestation practices even after payment cessation. Quantitative data also suggest carbon offset payments provided financial stability for poorer participants to diversify into other sources of income over time, while income inequality remained stable across wealth groups. Qualitative data indicate that the greatest benefit of the carbon offset project for participants was economic security for future generations, while concerns about basic needs like food and money declined over time for both participants and non-participants. This research suggests that forest carbon offset projects can be effective for encouraging long-term adoption of forestry practices, specifically reforestation and agroforestry, while providing social co-benefits for rural livelihoods, across wealth dimensions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Shinbrot","given":"Xoco A."},{"family":"Holmes","given":"Ignacia"},{"family":"Gauthier","given":"Madeleine"},{"family":"Tschakert","given":"Petra"},{"family":"Wilkins","given":"Zoë"},{"family":"Baragón","given":"Lydia"},{"family":"Opúa","given":"Berta"},{"family":"Potvin","given":"Catherine"}],"citation-key":"shinbrotNaturalFinancialImpacts2022","container-title":"Land Use Policy","container-title-short":"Land Use Policy","DOI":"10.1016/j.landusepol.2022.106047","ISSN":"0264-8377","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,1]]},"page":"106047","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Natural and financial impacts of payments for forest carbon offset: A 14 year-long case study in an indigenous community in Panama","title-short":"Natural and financial impacts of payments for forest carbon offset","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837722000746","volume":"115"},

  {"id":"shiveStandScaleLandscape2018","abstract":"Shifting disturbance regimes can have cascading effects on many ecosystems processes. This is particularly true when the scale of the disturbance no longer matches the regeneration strategy of the dominant vegetation. In the yellow pine and mixed conifer forests of California, over a century of fire exclusion and the warming climate are increasing the incidence and extent of stand-replacing wildfire; such changes in severity patterns are altering regeneration dynamics by dramatically increasing the distance from live tree seed sources. This has raised concerns about limitations to natural reforestation and the potential for conversion to non-forested vegetation types, which in turn has implications for shifts in many ecological processes and ecosystem services. We used a California region-wide data set with 1,848 plots across 24 wildfires in yellow pine and mixed conifer forests to build a spatially explicit habitat suitability model for forecasting postfire forest regeneration. To model the effect of seed availability, the critical initial biological filter for regeneration, we used a novel approach to predicting spatial patterns of seed availability by estimating annual seed production from existing basal area and burn severity maps. The probability of observing any conifer seedling in a 60m2 area (the field plot scale) was highly dependent on 30-yr average annual precipitation, burn severity, and seed availability. We then used this model to predict regeneration probabilities across the entire extent of a “new” fire (the 2014 King Fire), which highlights the spatial variability inherent in postfire regeneration patterns. Such forecasts of postfire regeneration patterns are of importance to land managers and conservationists interested in maintaining forest cover on the landscape. Our tool can also help anticipate shifts in ecosystem properties, supporting researchers interested in investigating questions surrounding alternative stable states, and the interaction of altered disturbance regimes and the changing climate.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Shive","given":"Kristen L."},{"family":"Preisler","given":"Haiganoush K."},{"family":"Welch","given":"Kevin R."},{"family":"Safford","given":"Hugh D."},{"family":"Butz","given":"Ramona J."},{"family":"O'Hara","given":"Kevin L."},{"family":"Stephens","given":"Scott L."}],"citation-key":"shiveStandScaleLandscape2018","container-title":"Ecological Applications","container-title-short":"Ecol Appl","DOI":"10.1002/eap.1756","ISSN":"10510761","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",9]]},"language":"en","page":"1626-1639","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"From the stand scale to the landscape scale: predicting the spatial patterns of forest regeneration after disturbance","title-short":"From the stand scale to the landscape scale","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eap.1756","volume":"28"},
  {"id":"sidesRevisitingDarwinHypothesis2014","abstract":"• Premise of the study: Darwin first proposed that species with larger ecological breadth have greater phenotypic variation. We tested this hypothesis by comparing intraspecific variation in specific leaf area (SLA) to species’ local elevational range and by assessing how external (abiotic) filters may influence observed differences in ecological breadth among species. Understanding the patterns of individual variation within and between populations will help evaluate differing hypotheses for structuring of communities and distribution of species. • Methods: We selected 21 species with varying elevational ranges and compared the coefficient of variation of SLA for each species against its local elevational range. We examined the influence of external filters on local trait composition by determining if intraspecific changes in SLA with elevation have the same direction and similar rates of change as the change in community mean SLA value. • Key results: In support of Darwin's hypothesis, we found a positive relationship between species’ coefficient of variation for SLA with species’ local elevational range. Intraspecific changes in SLA had the same sign, but generally lower magnitude than the community mean SLA. • Conclusions: The results indicate that wide-ranging species are indeed characterized by greater intraspecific variation and that species’ phenotypes shift along environmental gradients in the same direction as the community phenotypes. However, across species, the rate of intraspecific trait change, reflecting plastic and/or adaptive changes across populations, is limited and prevents species from adjusting to environmental gradients as quickly as interspecific changes resulting from community assembly.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Sides","given":"Colby B."},{"family":"Enquist","given":"Brian J."},{"family":"Ebersole","given":"James J."},{"family":"Smith","given":"Marielle N."},{"family":"Henderson","given":"Amanda N."},{"family":"Sloat","given":"Lindsey L."}],"citation-key":"sidesRevisitingDarwinHypothesis2014","container-title":"American Journal of Botany","DOI":"10.3732/ajb.1300284","ISSN":"1537-2197","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2014 Botanical Society of America","page":"56-62","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Revisiting Darwin's hypothesis: Does greater intraspecific variability increase species’ ecological breadth?","title-short":"Revisiting Darwin's hypothesis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3732/ajb.1300284","volume":"101"},

Nevertheless, several PAs present a funding deficit because governments allocate fewer financial resources than those required to cover PA management costs. The variation in funding deficits within countries is not well documented because information about PA public investments and management costs are seldom available. We describe the variation in funding deficits across Brazilian federal PAs and propose a model that explains such variation by using PAs' characteristics and their zones of influence as predictors. We estimated that the 282 Brazilian federal PAs needed US$ 468 million to cover their management costs in 2016. However, the Brazilian government allocated only 15.5 % of these costs. Approximately 76.5 % of the PAs had funding deficits. Our model showed that: (1) funding deficit is negatively associated with PA age and the human development index but positively associated with PA size, (2) PAs in the Atlantic Forest and the Savannas and Drylands have lower funding deficits than PAs in the Amazon, and (3) PAs in the Atlantic Forest have lower funding deficits than PAs in the Savannas and Drylands. We found that the proportion of PAs with a funding deficit in Brazil is high and is comparable to the high percentage of PAs (75 %–100 %) with a funding deficit found in sub-Saharan Africa. Moreover, there is evidence that the total annual funding deficit in the Brazilian PAs increased in the last decade. New policies, public-private partnerships, and innovative funding mechanisms need to be set to close the large funding gap in the Brazilian federal PA system.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Silva","given":"José Maria Cardoso","dropping-particle":"da"},{"family":"Dias","given":"Teresa Cristina Albuquerque de Castro"},{"family":"Cunha","given":"Alan Cavalcanti","dropping-particle":"da"},{"family":"Cunha","given":"Helenilza Ferreira Albuquerque"}],"citation-key":"silvaFundingDeficitsProtected2021","container-title":"Land Use Policy","container-title-short":"Land Use Policy","DOI":"10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.104926","ISSN":"0264-8377","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,1]]},"page":"104926","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Funding deficits of protected areas in Brazil","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837720306207","volume":"100"},
  {"id":"silvaFusingSimulatedGEDI2021","abstract":"Accurate mapping of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is critical for better understanding the role of forests in the global carbon cycle. NASA's current GEDI and ICESat-2 missions as well as the upcoming NISAR mission will collect synergistic data with different coverage and sensitivity to AGB. In this study, we present a multi-sensor data fusion approach leveraging the strength of each mission to produce wall-to-wall AGB maps that are more accurate and spatially comprehensive than what is achievable with any one sensor alone. Specifically, we calibrate a regional L-band radar AGB model using the sparse, simulated spaceborne lidar AGB estimates. We assess our data fusion framework using simulations of GEDI, ICESat-2 and NISAR data from airborne laser scanning (ALS) and UAVSAR data acquired over the temperate high AGB forest and complex terrain in Sonoma County, California, USA. For ICESat-2 and GEDI missions, we simulate two years of data coverage and AGB at footprint level are estimated using realistic AGB models. We compare the performance of our fusion framework when different combinations of the sparse simulated GEDI and ICEsat-2 AGB estimates are used to calibrate our regional L-band AGB models. In addition, we test our framework at Sonoma using (a) 1-ha square grid cells and (b) similarly sized irregularly shaped objects. We demonstrate that the estimated mean AGB across Sonoma is more accurately estimated using our fusion framework than using GEDI or ICESat-2 mission data alone, either with a regular grid or with irregular segments as mapping units. This research highlights methodological opportunities for fusing new and upcoming active remote sensing data streams toward improved AGB mapping through data fusion.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Silva","given":"Carlos Alberto"},{"family":"Duncanson","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Hancock","given":"Steven"},{"family":"Neuenschwander","given":"Amy"},{"family":"Thomas","given":"Nathan"},{"family":"Hofton","given":"Michelle"},{"family":"Fatoyinbo","given":"Lola"},{"family":"Simard","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Marshak","given":"Charles Z."},{"family":"Armston","given":"John"},{"family":"Lutchke","given":"Scott"},{"family":"Dubayah","given":"Ralph"}],"citation-key":"silvaFusingSimulatedGEDI2021","container-title":"Remote Sensing of Environment","container-title-short":"Remote Sensing of Environment","DOI":"10.1016/j.rse.2020.112234","ISSN":"0034-4257","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,1]]},"page":"112234","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Fusing simulated GEDI, ICESat-2 and NISAR data for regional aboveground biomass mapping","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425720306076","volume":"253"},

  {"id":"simoesGreenDesertsNot2024","abstract":"Tree monocultures constitute an increasing fraction of the global tree cover and are the dominant tree-growing strategy of forest landscape restoration commitments. Their advantages to produce timber are well known, but their value for biodiversity is highly controversial and context dependent. Therefore, understanding whether, and in which conditions, they can harbor native species regeneration is crucial. Here, we conducted meta-analyses based on a global survey of the literature and on a database created with local, unpublished studies throughout Brazil to evaluate the regeneration potential of native species under tree monocultures and the way management influences this regeneration. Native woody species regeneration under tree monocultures harbors a substantial fraction of the diversity (on average 40% and 68% in the global and Brazilian surveys, respectively) and abundance (on average 25% and 60% in the global and Brazilian surveys, respectively) of regeneration observed in natural forests. Plantations with longer rotation lengths, composed of native tree species, and located adjacent to forest remnants harbor more species. Pine plantations harbor more native individuals than eucalypt plantations, and the abundance of regenerating trees is higher in sites with higher mean temperatures. Species–area curves revealed that the number of woody species under pine and eucalypt plantations in Brazil is 606 and 598 species, respectively, over an aggregated sampled area of ca. 12 ha. We highlight that the understory of tree monocultures can harbor a considerable diversity of regenerating native species at the landscape and regional scales, but this diversity strongly depends on management. Long-rotation length and favorable location are key factors for woody regeneration success under tropical tree monocultures. Therefore, tree monocultures can play a role in forest landscape restoration and conservation, but only if they are planned and managed for achieving this purpose.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Simões","given":"Laura H.

However, high upfront costs and variable cashflows are obstacles for many landholders. Carbon payments have been promoted as a mechanism to incentivize restoration and economists have suggested cost-sharing by third parties to reduce financial burdens of restoration. Yet empirical evidence to support this theory, based on robust, dynamic field sampling is lacking. Here we use large, long-term datasets from Panama to evaluate the financial prospects of three forest restoration methods under different cost-sharing and carbon payment designs where income is generated through timber harvests.

Further work combining growth and survival data from field trials with more sophisticated financial analyses is essential to understanding barriers and realizing the potential of forest restoration in LMICs to help meet global carbon mitigation commitments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Sinacore","given":"Katherine"},{"family":"García","given":"Edwin H."},{"family":"Finkral","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Breugel","given":"Michiel","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Lopez","given":"Omar R."},{"family":"Espinosa","given":"Carlos"},{"family":"Miller","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Howard","given":"Theodore"},{"family":"Hall","given":"Jefferson S."}],"citation-key":"sinacoreMixedSuccessCarbon2023","container-title":"Nature Communications","container-title-short":"Nat Commun","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-023-43861-4","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,15]]},"language":"en","license":"2023 The Author(s)","number":"1","page":"8359","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Mixed success for carbon payments and subsidies in support of forest restoration in the neotropics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43861-4","volume":"14"},

Although a framework of essential biodiversity variables (EBVs) is emerging for monitoring biodiversity, its poor alignment with remote sensing products hinders interpolation between field observations. This study compiles a comprehensive, prioritized list of remote sensing biodiversity products that can further improve the monitoring of geospatial biodiversity patterns, enhancing the EBV framework and its applicability. The ecosystem structure and ecosystem function EBV classes, which capture the biological effects of disturbance as well as habitat structure, are shown by an expert review process to be the most relevant, feasible, accurate and mature for direct monitoring of biodiversity from satellites. Biodiversity products that require satellite remote sensing of a finer resolution that is still under development are given lower priority (for example, for the EBV class species traits). Some EBVs are not directly measurable by remote sensing from space, specifically the EBV class genetic composition.

  {"id":"smithAmazonianSecondaryForests2023","abstract":"Restoration of tropical landscapes through the expansion of secondary forests is crucial for climate change mitigation and offers co-benefits for biodiversity. However, the strength of these benefits is influenced by the position of these secondary forests within the landscape. Recovery of both carbon stocks and biodiversity in secondary forests are enhanced by proximity to old-growth forests, and old-growth forests may benefit from secondary forests in return through buffering of edge effects and reduced fragmentation. However, to date there has been no biome-wide assessment of secondary forest location relative to old-growth forests. We mapped Amazonian secondary forests and explored their proximity to old-growth forests of different conditions. We then calculated the extent to which secondary forests buffer old-growth edge forest (<120 m from an edge) and the influence of secondary forests on fragmentation. In 2020, 41.2% of Amazonian secondary forest was directly adjacent to old-growth forest and 94.1% was within a fragment connected to old growth. However, adjacency and connectedness fell to 20.1% and 57.4% respectively when only considering extensive structurally intact old-growth forest. Secondary forests buffered 41.1% of old-growth edge forest and, when acting as corridors, reduced the total number of old-growth fragments by 2 million. Our results reveal the importance of understanding spatial context when examining the potential benefits of increasing secondary forest cover. Improved understanding of the benefits of locating secondary forests next to old-growth forests could support the development of more effective climate change mitigation and restoration strategies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Smith","given":"Charlotte C."},{"family":"Barlow","given":"Jos"},{"family":"Healey","given":"John R."},{"family":"Miranda","given":"Leonardo de Sousa"},{"family":"Young","given":"Paul J."},{"family":"Schwartz","given":"Naomi B."}],"citation-key":"smithAmazonianSecondaryForests2023","container-title":"Environmental Research Letters","container-title-short":"Environ.

We analyzed the effects of a range of land‐use and climate‐change disturbances on fine‐scale canopy structure using a large database of profiling canopy lidar collected from disturbed and mature Amazon forest plots. At most of the disturbed sites, surveys were conducted 10–30 years after disturbance, with many exhibiting signs of recovery. Structural impacts differed in magnitude more than in character among disturbance types, producing a gradient of impacts. Structural changes were highly coordinated in a manner consistent across disturbance types, indicating commonalities in regeneration pathways. At the most severely affected site – burned igapó (seasonally flooded forest) – no signs of canopy regeneration were observed, indicating a sustained alteration of microclimates and consequently greater vulnerability to transitioning to a more open‐canopy, savanna‐like state. Notably, disturbances rarely shifted forests beyond the natural background of structural variation within mature plots, highlighting the similarities between anthropogenic and natural disturbance regimes, and indicating a degree of resilience among Amazon forests. Studying diverse disturbance types within an integrated analytical framework builds capacity to predict the risk of degradation‐driven forest transitions.","author":[{"family":"Smith","given":"Marielle"},{"family":"Stark","given":"Scott"},{"family":"Taylor","given":"Tyeen"},{"family":"Schietti","given":"Juliana"},{"family":"Almeida","given":"Danilo"},{"family":"Aragon","given":"Susan"},{"family":"Torralvo","given":"Kelly"},{"family":"Lima","given":"Albertina"},{"family":"Oliveira","given":"Gabriel"},{"family":"Assis","given":"Rafael"},{"family":"Leitold","given":"Veronika"},{"family":"Lopes","given":"Aline"},{"family":"Scoles","given":"Ricardo"},{"family":"Vieira","given":"Luciana"},{"family":"Resende","given":"Angelica"},{"family":"Coppola","given":"Alysha"},{"family":"Brandão","given":"Diego"},{"family":"Silva Junior","given":"João"},{"family":"Lobato","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Nelson","given":"Bruce"}],"citation-key":"smithDiverseAnthropogenicDisturbances2023","container-title":"Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment","container-title-short":"Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment","DOI":"10.1002/fee.2590","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,1]]},"page":"24-32","source":"ResearchGate","title":"Diverse anthropogenic disturbances shift Amazon forests along a structural spectrum","type":"article-journal","volume":"21"},
  {"id":"smithDynamicsSecondaryForests1999","abstract":"The regeneration of secondary forests (SF) on previously cleared land in the Amazon is a promising development within the generally pessimistic scenario about tropical deforestation. This has stimulated efforts to augment the value of SF to farmers to induce them to increase the area in SF. The objective of this paper was to document the regeneration of SF in slash-and-burn agriculture and to develop policy and technological recommendations for conserving forest cover on small farms and improve farmer welfare. The dynamics of SF in slash-and-burn farming were studied by investigating changes in the role of SF with frontier development. Farm survey data from a colonist settlement area in the Peruvian Amazon were analyzed by using a recursive econometric model. Results conﬁrmed that substantial areas of SF exist on slash-and-burn farms during the ﬁrst few decades after settlement. As a result, over a third of the farm area is under forest cover. This implies that deforestation in slash-and-burn farming may be less than previously believed. Soil recuperation is the most important reason for the existence of SF in slash-and-burn agriculture. During the relatively early stages of frontier development studied in this paper, fallow periods increased over time as site productivity declined, giving rise to secondary forests. Pastures lowered forested areas on farms and appear to impede the regeneration of SF. Commercial exploitation of SF products was minimal and declines with frontier development. The conclusions show that improved short-rotation fallows may recuperate the soil at the expense of forest cover, particularly in areas where most of the forest cover consists of SF. This conﬂict could be resolved by technologies that enrich SF and reinforce its multiple functions, including soil recuperation. Reduction of extensive cattle ranching may be a more effective way to conserve forest cover in slash-and-burn farming than technologies for shortening fallow periods. A ‘quantum leap’ in the beneﬁts of forested land will be required if increases in forest cover are to be compatible with farmer welfare. This is likely to require innovative approaches, such as commercialization of the environmental services of forests. The results of this research could potentially shift efforts to control deforestation away from slash-and-burn farmers, thus reducing the perceived conﬂict between forest conservation and the livelihood of poor people. ©1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Theory suggests that ecosystem resilience—the ability of ecosystems to resist and recover from external shocks such as droughts and fires—can be inferred from their natural variability. Here, we quantify vegetation resilience globally with complementary metrics based on two independent long-term satellite records. We first empirically confirm that the recovery rates from large perturbations can be closely approximated from internal vegetation variability across vegetation types and climate zones. On the basis of this empirical relationship, we quantify vegetation resilience continuously and globally from 1992 to 2017. Long-term vegetation resilience trends are spatially heterogeneous, with overall increasing resilience in the tropics and decreasing resilience at higher latitudes. Shorter-term trends, however, reveal a marked shift towards a global decline in vegetation resilience since the early 2000s, particularly in the equatorial rainforest belt.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Smith","given":"Taylor"},{"family":"Traxl","given":"Dominik"},{"family":"Boers","given":"Niklas"}],"citation-key":"smithEmpiricalEvidenceRecent2022","container-title":"Nature Climate Change","container-title-short":"Nat.

  {"id":"smithEmpiricalEvidenceResilience2020","abstract":"Tropical forests may be vulnerable to climate change1–3 if photosynthetic carbon uptake currently operates near a high temperature limit4–6. Predicting tropical forest function requires understanding the relative contributions of two mechanisms of high-temperature photosynthetic declines: stomatal limitation (H1), an indirect response due to temperature-associated changes in atmospheric vapour pressure deficit (VPD)7, and biochemical restrictions (H2), a direct temperature response8,9. Their relative control predicts different outcomes—H1 is expected to diminish with stomatal responses to future co-occurring elevated atmospheric [CO2], whereas H2 portends declining photosynthesis with increasing temperatures. Distinguishing the two mechanisms at high temperatures is therefore critical, but difficult because VPD is highly correlated with temperature in natural settings. We used a forest mesocosm to quantify the sensitivity of tropical gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) to future temperature regimes while constraining VPD by controlling humidity. We then analytically decoupled temperature and VPD effects under current climate with flux-tower-derived GEP trends in situ from four tropical forest sites. Both approaches showed consistent, negative sensitivity of GEP to VPD but little direct response to temperature. Importantly, in the mesocosm at low VPD, GEP persisted up to 38 °C, a temperature exceeding projections for tropical forests in 2100 (ref. 10). If elevated [CO2] mitigates VPD-induced stomatal limitation through enhanced water-use efficiency as hypothesized9,11, tropical forest photosynthesis may have a margin of resilience to future warming.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Smith","given":"Marielle N."},{"family":"Taylor","given":"Tyeen C."},{"family":"Haren","given":"Joost","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Rosolem","given":"Rafael"},{"family":"Restrepo-Coupe","given":"Natalia"},{"family":"Adams","given":"John"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Jin"},{"family":"Oliveira","given":"Raimundo C.","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Silva","given":"Rodrigo","non-dropping-particle":"da"},{"family":"Araujo","given":"Alessandro C.","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Camargo","given":"Plinio B.","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Huxman","given":"Travis E."},{"family":"Saleska","given":"Scott R."}],"citation-key":"smithEmpiricalEvidenceResilience2020","container-title":"Nature Plants","container-title-short":"Nat.

  {"id":"smithOldgrowthForestLoss2021","abstract":"There is growing recognition of the potential of large-scale forest restoration in the Amazon as a ‘nature-based solution’ to climate change. However, our knowledge of forest loss and recovery beyond Brazil is limited, and carbon emissions and accumulation have not been estimated for the whole biome. Combining a 33 year land cover dataset with estimates of above-ground biomass and carbon sequestration rates, we evaluate forest loss and recovery across nine Amazonian countries and at a local scale. We also estimate the role of secondary forests in offsetting old-growth deforestation emissions and explore the temporal trends in forest loss and recovery. We find secondary forests across the biome to have offset just 9.7% of carbon emissions from old-growth deforestation, despite occupying 28.8% of deforested land. However, these numbers varied between countries ranging from 9.0% in Brazil to 23.8% in Guyana for carbon offsetting, and 24.8% in Brazil to 56.9% in Ecuador for forest area recovery. We reveal a strong, negative spatial relationship between old-growth forest loss and recovery by secondary forests, showing that regions with the greatest potential for large-scale restoration are also those that currently have the lowest recovery (e.g. Brazil dominates deforestation and emissions but has the lowest recovery). In addition, a temporal analysis of the regions that were >80% deforested in 1997 shows a continued decline in overall forest cover. Our findings identify three important challenges: (a) incentivising large-scale restoration in highly deforested regions, (b) protecting secondary forests without disadvantaging landowners who depend on farm-fallow systems, and (c) preventing further deforestation. Combatting all these successfully is essential to ensuring that the Amazon biome achieves its potential in mitigating anthropogenic climate change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Smith","given":"Charlotte C"},{"family":"Healey","given":"John R"},{"family":"Berenguer","given":"Erika"},{"family":"Young","given":"Paul J"},{"family":"Taylor","given":"Ben"},{"family":"Elias","given":"Fernando"},{"family":"Espírito-Santo","given":"Fernando"},{"family":"Barlow","given":"Jos"}],"citation-key":"smithOldgrowthForestLoss2021","container-title":"Environmental Research Letters","container-title-short":"Environ.

We also assessed whether secondary forests in the Brazilian Amazon are growing in conditions favourable for carbon accumulation in relation to a suite of climatic, landscape and local factors. In 2017, the 129,361 km2 of secondary forest in the Brazilian Amazon stored 0.33 ± 0.05 billion Mg of above-ground carbon but had offset just 9.37% of old-growth emissions since 1985. However, we find that the majority of Brazilian secondary forests are situated in contexts that are less favourable for carbon accumulation than the biome average. Our results demonstrate that old-growth forest loss remains the most important factor determining the carbon balance in the Brazilian Amazon. Understanding the implications of these findings will be essential for improving estimates of secondary forest carbon sequestration potential. More accurate quantification of secondary forest carbon stocks will support the production of appropriate management proposals that can efficiently harness the potential of secondary forests as a low-cost, nature-based tool for mitigating climate change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Smith","given":"Charlotte C."},{"family":"Espírito-Santo","given":"Fernando D.

Understanding how microbial communities respond to changes in vegetation is critical for improving predictions of how land-cover change affects belowground carbon storage and nutrient availability. We measured intra- and interannual variability in soil and forest litter microbial community composition and activity via phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA) and extracellular enzyme activity across a well-replicated, long-term chronosequence of secondary forests growing on abandoned pastures in the wet subtropical forest life zone of Puerto Rico. Microbial community PLFA structure differed between young secondary forests and older secondary and primary forests, following successional shifts in tree species composition. These successional patterns held across seasons, but the microbial groups driving these patterns differed over time. Microbial community composition from the forest litter differed greatly from those in the soil, but did not show the same successional trends. Extracellular enzyme activity did not differ with forest succession, but varied by season with greater rates of potential activity in the dry seasons. We found few robust signiﬁcant relationships among microbial community parameters and soil pH, moisture, carbon, and nitrogen concentrations. Observed inter- and intrannual variability in microbial community structure and activity reveal the importance of a multiple, temporal sampling strategy when investigating microbial community dynamics with land-use change. Successional control over microbial composition with forest recovery suggests strong links between above and belowground communities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Smith","given":"A.

  {"id":"smithUsingBigData2022","abstract":"The scale of information required to inform global climate change and biodiversity initiatives goes beyond traditional environmental monitoring and into the realms of big data. Halting deforestation and restoring the world’s forests is key to the success of such initiatives and there is growing recognition of the potential of large-scale restoration in the Amazon as a “nature-based solution” for both climate change and biodiversity loss. But our understanding of forest loss and recovery in the Amazon is incomplete. In this thesis I use MapBiomas, a 30-m resolution annual timeseries of Amazonian landcover from 1985 to 2020, to address knowledge gaps surrounding secondary forests and their role in carbon accumulation and habitat provisioning. Chapter 2 maps the extent, age, and carbon stocks of secondary forest in the Brazilian Amazon and explores their distribution relative to key variables known to influence secondary forest carbon accumulation. The findings show that, in 2017, despite occupying 20% of deforested land, secondary forests had offset less than 10% of deforestation emissions. Furthermore, they were typically situated in contexts that are less favourable for carbon accumulation. These results demonstrate that old-growth forest loss remains the most important factor determining the carbon balance of the Brazilian Amazon. Chapter 3 evaluates spatial and temporal trends in forest loss and recovery across all nine Amazonian countries. The findings reveal a strong, negative spatial relationship between old-growth forest loss and recovery by secondary forests, showing that regions with the greatest area available for large-scale restoration are also those that currently have the lowest recovery. This chapter also highlights the variation between countries; Brazil has both the highest percentage of deforestation and the lowest percentage of secondary forest recovery. Chapter 4 explores the co-location of old-growth and secondary forests. It finds that while 41% and 94% of secondary forests are adjacent or connected to old-growth forests, these values decline to 20% and 57% when considering adjacency and connectivity with structurally intact and extensive old-growth forest. It also reveals that secondary forests buffer over 40% of old-growth forest edges and reduce the number of isolated old-growth fragments by ~2 million. Chapter 5 explores the impact of deforestation, disturbance, and regeneration on habitat availability for species with different tolerances for disturbance. It reveals that, although old-growth forest cover has only reduced by 8.6%, there has been a 40% decline in biome-wide habitat for disturbance-sensitive species since 1985, with 79% of the loss due to changes in forest condition rather than extent. Overall, this thesis provides new insights into changes in forest cover and condition in the Amazon biome and demonstrates the power of big data for answering environmental questions at large spatial scales.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Smith","given":"Charlotte Caroline"}],"citation-key":"smithUsingBigData2022","event-place":"England","genre":"Ph.D.","ISBN":"9798352600641","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"English","license":"Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","number-of-pages":"193","publisher":"Lancaster University (United Kingdom)","publisher-place":"England","source":"ProQuest","title":"Using Big Data to Understand Carbon Recovery and Habitat Availability in the Amazon Biome","type":"thesis","URL":"https://www.proquest.com/docview/2723854444/abstract/D09D12047F0541F4PQ/1"},

  {"id":"soares-filhoRoleBrazilianAmazon2010","abstract":"Protected areas (PAs) now shelter 54% of the remaining forests of the Brazilian Amazon and contain 56% of its forest carbon. However, the role of these PAs in reducing carbon fluxes to the atmosphere from deforestation and their associated costs are still uncertain. To fill this gap, we analyzed the effect of each of 595 Brazilian Amazon PAs on deforestation using a metric that accounts for differences in probability of deforestation in areas of pairwise comparison. We found that the three major categories of PA (indigenous land, strictly protected, and sustainable use) showed an inhibitory effect, on average, between 1997 and 2008. Of 206 PAs created after the year 1999, 115 showed increased effectiveness after their designation as protected. The recent expansion of PAs in the Brazilian Amazon was responsible for 37% of the region's total reduction in deforestation between 2004 and 2006 without provoking leakage. All PAs, if fully implemented, have the potential to avoid 8.0 ± 2.8 Pg of carbon emissions by 2050. Effectively implementing PAs in zones under high current or future anthropogenic threat offers high payoffs for reducing carbon emissions, and as a result should receive special attention in planning investments for regional conservation. Nevertheless, this strategy demands prompt and predictable resource streams. The Amazon PA network represents a cost of US$147 ± 53 billion (net present value) for Brazil in terms of forgone profits and investments needed for their consolidation. These costs could be partially compensated by an international climate accord that includes economic incentives for tropical countries that reduce their carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Soares-Filho","given":"Britaldo"},{"family":"Moutinho","given":"Paulo"},{"family":"Nepstad","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Anderson","given":"Anthony"},{"family":"Rodrigues","given":"Hermann"},{"family":"Garcia","given":"Ricardo"},{"family":"Dietzsch","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Merry","given":"Frank"},{"family":"Bowman","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Hissa","given":"Letícia"},{"family":"Silvestrini","given":"Rafaella"},{"family":"Maretti","given":"Cláudio"}],"citation-key":"soares-filhoRoleBrazilianAmazon2010","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.0913048107","issue":"24","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",6,15]]},"page":"10821-10826","publisher":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","source":"www-pnas-org.proxy3.library.mcgill.ca (Atypon)","title":"Role of Brazilian Amazon protected areas in climate change mitigation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.0913048107","volume":"107"},

  {"id":"sousaWaterTableDepth2022","abstract":"Aim Water availability is the major driver of tropical forest structure and dynamics. Most research has focused on the impacts of climatic water availability, whereas remarkably little is known about the influence of water table depth and excess soil water on forest processes. Nevertheless, given that plants take up water from the soil, the impacts of climatic water supply on plants are likely to be modulated by soil water conditions. Location Lowland Amazonian forests. Time period 1971–2019. Methods We used 344 long-term inventory plots distributed across Amazonia to analyse the effects of long-term climatic and edaphic water supply on forest functioning. We modelled forest structure and dynamics as a function of climatic, soil-water and edaphic properties. Results Water supplied by both precipitation and groundwater affects forest structure and dynamics, but in different ways. Forests with a shallow water table (depth <5 m) had 18% less above-ground woody productivity and 23% less biomass stock than forests with a deep water table. Forests in drier climates (maximum cumulative water deficit < −160 mm) had 21% less productivity and 24% less biomass than those in wetter climates. Productivity was affected by the interaction between climatic water deficit and water table depth. On average, in drier climates the forests with a shallow water table had lower productivity than those with a deep water table, with this difference decreasing within wet climates, where lower productivity was confined to a very shallow water table. Main conclusions We show that the two extremes of water availability (excess and deficit) both reduce productivity in Amazon upland (terra-firme) forests. Biomass and productivity across Amazonia respond not simply to regional climate, but rather to its interaction with water table conditions, exhibiting high local differentiation. Our study disentangles the relative contribution of those factors, helping to improve understanding of the functioning of tropical ecosystems and how they are likely to respond to climate change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Sousa","given":"Thaiane R."},{"family":"Schietti","given":"Juliana"},{"family":"Ribeiro","given":"Igor O."},{"family":"Emílio","given":"Thaise"},{"family":"Fernández","given":"Rafael Herrera"},{"family":"Steege","given":"Hans","non-dropping-particle":"ter"},{"family":"Castilho","given":"Carolina V."},{"family":"Esquivel-Muelbert","given":"Adriane"},{"family":"Baker","given":"Timothy"},{"family":"Pontes-Lopes","given":"Aline"},{"family":"Silva","given":"Camila V.

  {"id":"souzaoliveiraBiomassTimberSpecies2021","abstract":"Sustainable management of secondary forests for timber production offers the opportunity to combine nature-based climate change mitigation with direct improvement of human livelihoods in the tropics, but this dual potential has rarely been explored. We characterized aboveground biomass (AGB) in secondary forests (SF) in Nicaragua and Costa Rica in whole stands (ecological potential), individual trees of timber species (total timber potential), and currently harvestable timber (harvestable timber potential). We also linked the three types of AGB potential to climate and soil factors. Data on 302 sample plots were collected, most from national forest inventories (NFIs) concerning 168 plots in Nicaragua and 134 plots in Costa Rica. We analyzed data from individuals ≥20 cm dbh, estimating biomass from field measurements of stem diameters, and wood density and tree height estimates from the BIOMASS package in R. We obtained climate data from CHELSA, soil data from the ISRIC world soils database and determined the relationship between the three AGB potentials and environmental variables using exploratory principal components analysis and general linear mixed models (GLMMs). A mean 51 Mg ha−1 AGB was found to be stored in trees ≥20 cm dbh in dry forests and 68 Mg ha−1 in wet forests. Maximum values were > 250 Mg ha−1 in both biomes, similar to primary forest values from the NFIs. Timber potential was high at 84% of the mean ecological potential of the study plots, with 73% in the currently harvestable category. Overall, both ecological and total timber potential AGB were significantly higher in wet than in dry forests, whereas currently harvestable timber potential was significantly higher in dry than in wet forests. The best GLMMs showed R2 = 0.31, 0.24 and 0.27 for ecological, total timber and harvestable timber potentials, respectively (P < 0.0001). All three models included soil clay and silt fractions, soil C/N ratio, mean annual precipitation and temperature seasonality. The GLMM for ecological potential included soil pH and climatic water deficit, while those for the two timber potentials included mean annual temperature. Overall, GLMMs indicate increasing timber AGB potential with increasing rainfall, decreasing climatic seasonality, and soil fertility. All three AGB potentials were significantly higher in Costa Rica than in Nicaragua in both biomes. This observed non-environmental “country effect” requires further study.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Souza Oliveira","given":"Maïri"},{"family":"Finegan","given":"Bryan"},{"family":"Casanoves","given":"Fernando"},{"family":"Delgado","given":"Diego"},{"family":"Sepulveda","given":"Norvin"},{"family":"Aguilar Porras","given":"Adriana"},{"family":"Chamorro","given":"María Alejandra"},{"family":"Morales Aymerich","given":"Jean Pierre"},{"family":"Ngo Bieng","given":"Marie Ange"}],"citation-key":"souzaoliveiraBiomassTimberSpecies2021","container-title":"Forest Ecology and Management","container-title-short":"Forest Ecology and Management","DOI":"10.1016/j.foreco.2021.119439","ISSN":"0378-1127","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,15]]},"page":"119439","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Biomass of timber species in Central American secondary forests: Towards climate change mitigation through sustainable timber harvesting","title-short":"Biomass of timber species in Central American secondary forests","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112721005284","volume":"496"},

However, there is still a gap of annual land use and land cover (LULC) information in all Brazilian biomes in the country. Existing countrywide eﬀorts to map land use and land cover lack regularly updates and high spatial resolution time-series data to better understand historical land use and land cover dynamics, and the subsequent impacts in the country biomes. In this study, we described a novel approach and the results achieved by a multi-disciplinary network called MapBiomas to reconstruct annual land use and land cover information between 1985 and 2017 for Brazil, based on random forest applied to Landsat archive using Google Earth Engine. We mapped ﬁve major classes: forest, non-forest natural formation, farming, non-vegetated areas, and water. These classes were broken into two sub-classiﬁcation levels leading to the most comprehensive and detailed mapping for the country at a 30 m pixel resolution. The average overall accuracy of the land use and land cover time-series, based on a stratiﬁed random sample of 75,000 pixel locations, was 89% ranging from 73 to 95% in the biomes. The 33 years of LULC change data series revealed that Brazil lost 71 Mha of natural vegetation, mostly to cattle ranching and agriculture activities. Pasture expanded by 46% from 1985 to 2017, and agriculture by 172%, mostly replacing old pasture ﬁelds.

  {"id":"spakeUnderstandingItDepends2023","abstract":"Ecologists routinely use statistical models to detect and explain interactions among ecological drivers, with a goal to evaluate whether an effect of interest changes in sign or magnitude in different contexts. Two fundamental properties of interactions are often overlooked during the process of hypothesising, visualising and interpreting interactions between drivers: the measurement scale – whether a response is analysed on an additive or multiplicative scale, such as a ratio or logarithmic scale; and the symmetry – whether dependencies are considered in both directions. Overlooking these properties can lead to one or more of three inferential errors: misinterpretation of (i) the detection and magnitude (Type-D error), and (ii) the sign of effect modiﬁcation (Type-S error); and (iii) misidentiﬁcation of the underlying processes (Type-A error). We illustrate each of these errors with a broad range of ecological questions applied to empirical and simulated data sets. We demonstrate how meta-analysis, a widely used approach that seeks explicitly to characterise context dependence, is especially prone to all three errors. Based on these insights, we propose guidelines to improve hypothesis generation, testing, visualisation and interpretation of interactions in ecology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Spake","given":"Rebecca"},{"family":"Bowler","given":"Diana E."},{"family":"Callaghan","given":"Corey T."},{"family":"Blowes","given":"Shane A."},{"family":"Doncaster","given":"C.

We analyse several options for reducing the environmental effects of the food system, including dietary changes towards healthier, more plant-based diets, improvements in technologies and management, and reductions in food loss and waste.

It is, therefore, important to understand the historical changes that have occurred and how the forests will change in the future, which provides the objective of this study. To determine the historical deforestation trends and link them to the different biogeophysical and socioeconomic variables, forest maps from 1960 to 2013 were used in the Dinamica Environment for Geoprocessing Objects (Dinamica EGO) to create deforestation models for Costa Rica. The base model was built and analyzed for changes in landscape metrics such as patch size and distance between 1960 and 2013. After validation of the model’s ability to replicate patterns, the landscape change was then projected to 2069. The historical model validated at 85% accuracy within 600 m for both the 2005–2013 and 1997–2005 iterations. All national future projections exhibited an increase in forest area, including the most extreme deforestation scenarios. Future projections are increasingly important given changes in the global socio-political structure, climatic change, and the ever-increasing globalization of capitalistic endeavors. The trajectory of the forest in Costa Rica can also serve as a way to track both these global pressures on the natural landscape, and as a proxy for how to manage deforestation in other similar political and geographic areas of the tropics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Stan","given":"Kayla"},{"family":"Sanchez-Azofeifa","given":"Arturo"}],"citation-key":"stanDeforestationSecondaryGrowth2019","container-title":"Regional Environmental Change","container-title-short":"Reg Environ Change","DOI":"10.1007/s10113-018-1432-5","ISSN":"1436-378X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"587-597","source":"Springer Link","title":"Deforestation and secondary growth in Costa Rica along the path of development","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10113-018-1432-5","volume":"19"},

The large, canopy-emergent Bertholletia excelsa also supports a multimillion-dollar commodity crop (Brazil nut), harvested almost exclusively from Amazonian forests. B. excelsa fruit production, however is extremely variable within populations and years, destabilizing local harvester livelihoods and the extractive economy. To understand this variability, data were collected in Acre, Brazil over 10 years at two sites with similar climate and forest types, but different fruit production levels, despite their proximity (~ 30 km). One site consistently produced more fruit, showed less individual- and population-level variability, and had significantly higher soil P and K levels. The strongest predictor of fruit production was crown area. Elevation and sapwood area also significantly impacted fruit production, but effects differed by site. While number of wet days and dry season vapor pressure prior to flowering were significant production predictors, no climatic variables completely captured annual observed variation. Trees on the site with higher available P and K produced nearly three times more fruits, and appeared more resilient to prolonged drought and drier atmospheric conditions. Management activities, such as targeted fertilization, may shield income-dependent harvesters from expected climate changes and production swings, ultimately contributing to conservation of old growth forests where this species thrives.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Staudhammer","given":"Christina L."},{"family":"Wadt","given":"Lúcia Helena O."},{"family":"Kainer","given":"Karen A."},{"family":"Cunha","given":"Thiago Augusto","non-dropping-particle":"da"}],"citation-key":"staudhammerComparativeModelsDisentangle2021","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-021-81948-4","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,28]]},"language":"en","license":"2021 The Author(s)","number":"1","page":"2563","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www-nature-com.proxy3.library.mcgill.ca","title":"Comparative models disentangle drivers of fruit production variability of an economically and ecologically important long-lived Amazonian tree","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-81948-4","volume":"11"},

Equity issues remain stubbornly difficult to solve. This situation is novel in its speed, its global scale and its threat to the resilience of the Earth System. The advent of the Anthropence, the time interval in which human activities now rival global geophysical processes, suggests that we need to fundamentally alter our relationship with the planet we inhabit. Many approaches could be adopted, ranging from geo-engineering solutions that purposefully manipulate parts of the Earth System to becoming active stewards of our own life support system. The Anthropocene is a reminder that the Holocene, during which complex human societies have developed, has been a stable, accommodating environment and is the only state of the Earth System that we know for sure can support contemporary society. The need to achieve effective planetary stewardship is urgent. As we go further into the Anthropocene, we risk driving the Earth System onto a trajectory toward more hostile states from which we cannot easily return.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Steffen","given":"Will"},{"family":"Persson","given":"Åsa"},{"family":"Deutsch","given":"Lisa"},{"family":"Zalasiewicz","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Williams","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Richardson","given":"Katherine"},{"family":"Crumley","given":"Carole"},{"family":"Crutzen","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Folke","given":"Carl"},{"family":"Gordon","given":"Line"},{"family":"Molina","given":"Mario"},{"family":"Ramanathan","given":"Veerabhadran"},{"family":"Rockström","given":"Johan"},{"family":"Scheffer","given":"Marten"},{"family":"Schellnhuber","given":"Hans Joachim"},{"family":"Svedin","given":"Uno"}],"citation-key":"steffenAnthropoceneGlobalChange2011","container-title":"AMBIO","container-title-short":"AMBIO","DOI":"10.1007/s13280-011-0185-x","ISSN":"1654-7209","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"739-761","source":"Springer Link","title":"The Anthropocene: From Global Change to Planetary Stewardship","title-short":"The Anthropocene","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s13280-011-0185-x","volume":"40"},

We systematically reviewed the empirical evidence of relationships between three ecosystem services: carbon stock and sequestration, timber provisioning and non-timber forest product (NTFP) provisioning, and three dimensions of plant diversity: taxonomic, functional and structural. We carried out meta-analyses to assess their validity across spatial scales and plot sizes. We found that indicators of all three dimensions of plant diversity have reported relationships with at least two of the studied ecosystem services, but there has been limited and inconsistent use of plant diversity indicators and little attention for relationships with timber and NTFP services. Nevertheless, we found that tree species richness showed robust significant positive correlations with carbon stock across the tropics, and that the geographical extent of the study area had a significant negative effect on the strength of this relationship, where the strength of the relationship decreased with increasing geographical extent. This paper reveals a knowledge gap for services other than carbon stock and shows that at local to regional spatial scales, synergies can be achieved between policies focused on biodiversity conservation and maintenance of carbon stocks.","author":[{"family":"Steur","given":"Gijs"},{"family":"Verburg","given":"René W."},{"family":"Wassen","given":"Martin J."},{"family":"Verweij","given":"Pita A."}],"citation-key":"steurSheddingLightRelationships2020","container-title":"Ecosystem Services","DOI":"10.1016/J.ECOSER.2020.101107","ISSN":"2212-0416","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",6,1]]},"page":"101107","title":"Shedding light on relationships between plant diversity and tropical forest ecosystem services across spatial scales and plot sizes","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/J.ECOSER.2020.101107","volume":"43"},

Although ambitious national and global targets have been set, global priority areas that account for spatial variation in benefits and costs have yet to be identified. Here we develop and apply a multicriteria optimization approach that identifies priority areas for restoration across all terrestrial biomes, and estimates their benefits and costs. We find that restoring 15% of converted lands in priority areas could avoid 60% of expected extinctions while sequestering 299 gigatonnes of CO2—30% of the total CO2 increase in the atmosphere, or 14% of total emissions, since the Industrial Revolution. The inclusion of several biomes is key to achieving multiple benefits. Cost effectiveness can increase up to 13-fold when spatial allocation is optimized using our multicriteria approach, which highlights the importance of spatial planning.

  {"id":"sullivanBiogeochemicalRecuperationLowland2019","abstract":"High rates of land conversion and land use change have vastly increased the proportion of secondary forest in the lowland tropics relative to mature forest. As secondary forests recover following abandonment, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) must be present in sufficient quantities to sustain high rates of net primary production and to replenish the nutrients lost during land use prior to secondary forest establishment. Biogeochemical theory and results from individual studies suggest that N can recuperate during secondary forest recovery, especially relative to P. Here, we synthesized 23 metrics of N and P in soil and plants from 45 secondary forest chronosequences located in the wet tropics to empirically explore (1) whether there is a consistent change in nutrients and nutrient cycling processes during secondary succession in the biome; (2) which metrics of N and P in soil and plants recuperate most consistently; (3) if the recuperation of nutrients during succession approaches similar nutrient concentrations and fluxes as those in mature forest in ~100 yr following the initiation of succession; and (4) whether site characteristics, including disturbance history, climate, and soil order are significantly related to nutrient recuperation. During secondary forest succession, nine metrics of N and/or P cycling changed consistently and substantially. In most sites, N concentrations and fluxes in both plants and soil increased during secondary succession, and total P concentrations increased in surface soil. Changes in nutrient concentrations and nutrient cycling processes during secondary succession were similar whether mature forest was included or excluded from the analysis, indicating that nutrient recuperation in secondary forest leads to biogeochemical conditions that are similar to those of mature forest. Further, of the N and P metrics that recuperated, only soil total P and foliar d15N were strongly influenced by site characteristics like climate, soils, or disturbance history. Predictable nutrient recuperation across a diverse and productive ecosystem may support future forest growth and could provide a means to quantify successful restoration of ecosystem function in secondary tropical forest beyond biomass or species composition.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Sullivan","given":"Benjamin W."},{"family":"Nifong","given":"Rachel L."},{"family":"Nasto","given":"Megan K."},{"family":"Alvarez‐Clare","given":"Silvia"},{"family":"Dencker","given":"Camie M."},{"family":"Soper","given":"Fiona M."},{"family":"Shoemaker","given":"Kevin T."},{"family":"Ishida","given":"F.

  {"id":"suzukiNonrandomSpatialCoupling2012","abstract":"The metacommunity perspective has attracted much attention recently, but the understanding of how dispersal between local communities alters their ecological dynamics is still limited, especially regarding the effect of non-random, unequal dispersal of organisms. This is a study of a three-trophiclevel (predator–prey–resource) system that is connected by different manners of dispersal. The model is based on a well-studied experimental system cultured in chemostats (continuous ﬂow-through culture), which consists of rotifer predator, algal prey and nutrient. In the model, nutrient dispersal can give rise to multistability when the two systems are connected by nutrient dispersal, whereas threetrophic-level systems tend to show a rich dynamical behavior, e.g. antisynchronous or asynchronous oscillations including chaos. Although the existence of multistability was already known in twotrophic-level (predator–prey) systems, it was conﬁned to a small range of dispersal rate. In contrast, the multistability in the three-trophic-level system is found in a broader range of dispersal rate. The results suggest that, in three-trophic-level systems, the dispersal of nutrient not only alters population dynamics of local systems but can also cause regime shifts such as a transition to different oscillation phases.","author":[{"family":"Suzuki","given":"Kenta"}],"citation-key":"suzukiNonrandomSpatialCoupling2012","container-title":"Journal of Theoretical Biology","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Non-random spatial coupling induces desynchronization, chaos and multistability in a predator–prey–resource system","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"tabarelliFewWinnersMany2012","abstract":"Despite its relevance to contemporary biodiversity conservation, the ecological mechanisms controlling nonrandom species replacements and biotic homogenization of native biotas remain poorly understood. Here, we advocate for the widespread occurrence of a pattern of winner–loser species turnover exhibited in tropical forest ﬂoras: the replacement of old-growth tree species by a small set of pioneer or successional tree species across edge-dominated habitats in hyper-fragmented landscapes. A growing body of evidence on biotic reassembly in human-degraded forest sites suggests that winner–loser replacements are often advanced by native rather than exotic plant species, leading to taxonomic homogenization at multiple spatial scales (i.e. from local to regional assemblages). This process does not rely on biological invasions and associated shifts in geographic ranges of nonindigenous species. Moreover, this form of biodiversity erosion is not limited to restricted-range and endemic species but can include any species of many ecological groups that are apparently intolerant to highly modiﬁed habitat conditions, such as desiccated/illuminated forest edges and ﬁre-degraded forest fragments persisting in open-habitat matrices. This unidirectional pattern of species turnover is expected to set in motion devastating cascading effects onto higher trophic levels that will eventually disrupt the structure of the entire forest ecosystem. Our framework not only reafﬁrms the winner–loser replacement paradigm, but also contends that the proliferation of disturbance-adapted native organisms has a pivotal role in sealing the fate of tropical biodiversity in particular contexts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Tabarelli","given":"Marcelo"},{"family":"Peres","given":"Carlos A."},{"family":"Melo","given":"Felipe P.L."}],"citation-key":"tabarelliFewWinnersMany2012","container-title":"Biological Conservation","container-title-short":"Biological Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/j.biocon.2012.06.020","ISSN":"00063207","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",10]]},"language":"en","page":"136-140","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The ‘few winners and many losers’ paradigm revisited: Emerging prospects for tropical forest biodiversity","title-short":"The ‘few winners and many losers’ paradigm revisited","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006320712002893","volume":"155"},

Based on the available information, it is reasonable to predict that in some landscapes or biotas: (1) small forest remnants degenerate and support plant assemblages with attributes similar to those observed in early and intermediate-aged regenerating stands, while secondary-forest stands move from initial to more advanced successional stages; (2) collectively, remnant/stand attributes and landscape integrity define the pace through which degeneration proceeds, but also the potential for regeneration; (3) at the landscape spatial scale, remnants and stands tend to converge in terms of structure, but also in terms of taxonomic and functional composition. In other words, remnants degenerate and secondary-forest stands regenerate toward a sort of ‘climax community’, which is conditioned by the physical and biological integrity of both patch and landscape. Considering secondary forests in the conceptual, ecological and spatial framework of human-modified landscapes may help us to understand and maximize the conservation services provided by this habitat as it proliferates through human-modified landscapes.","author":[{"family":"Tabarelli","given":"Marcelo"},{"family":"Santos","given":"Bráulio Almeida"},{"family":"Arroyo-Rodríguez","given":"Victor"}],"citation-key":"tabarelliSecondaryForestsBiodiversity2012","container-title-short":"Bol.

How soil organic carbon (SOC) forms and persists remains uncertain1,3, which makes it challenging to understand how it will respond to climatic change3,4. It has been suggested that soil microorganisms play an important role in SOC formation, preservation and loss5–7. Although microorganisms affect the accumulation and loss of soil organic matter through many pathways4,6,8–11, microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE) is an integrative metric that can capture the balance of these processes12,13. Although CUE has the potential to act as a predictor of variation in SOC storage, the role of CUE in SOC persistence remains unresolved7,14,15. Here we examine the relationship between CUE and the preservation of SOC, and interactions with climate, vegetation and edaphic properties, using a combination of global-scale datasets, a microbial-process explicit model, data assimilation, deep learning and meta-analysis. We find that CUE is at least four times as important as other evaluated factors, such as carbon input, decomposition or vertical transport, in determining SOC storage and its spatial variation across the globe. In addition, CUE shows a positive correlation with SOC content. Our findings point to microbial CUE as a major determinant of global SOC storage. Understanding the microbial processes underlying CUE and their environmental dependence may help the prediction of SOC feedback to a changing climate.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Tao","given":"Feng"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Yuanyuan"},{"family":"Hungate","given":"Bruce A."},{"family":"Manzoni","given":"Stefano"},{"family":"Frey","given":"Serita D."},{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Michael W.

  {"id":"taylorLandscapescaleControlsAboveground2015","abstract":"Tropical forests store large amounts of carbon in tree biomass, although the environmental controls on forest carbon stocks remain poorly resolved. Emerging airborne remote sensing techniques offer a powerful approach to understand how aboveground carbon density (ACD) varies across tropical landscapes. In this study, we evaluate the accuracy of the Carnegie Airborne Observatory (CAO) Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) system to detect top-of-canopy tree height (TCH) and ACD across the Osa Peninsula, Costa Rica. LiDAR and field-estimated TCH and ACD were highly correlated across a wide range of forest ages and types. Top-of-canopy height (TCH) reached 67 m, and ACD surpassed 225 Mg C ha-1 , indicating both that airborne CAO LiDAR-based estimates of ACD are accurate in tall, high-biomass forests and that the Osa Peninsula harbors some of the most carbon-rich forests in the Neotropics. We also examined the relative influence of lithologic, topoedaphic and climatic factors on regional patterns in ACD, which are known to influence ACD by regulating forest productivity and turnover. Analyses revealed a spatially nested set of factors controlling ACD patterns, with geologic variation explaining up to 16% of the mapped ACD variation at the regional scale, while local variation in topographic slope explained an additional 18%. Lithologic and topoedaphic factors also explained more ACD variation at 30-m than at 100- m spatial resolution, suggesting that environmental filtering depends on the spatial scale of terrain variation. Our result indicate that patterns in ACD are partially controlled by spatial variation in geologic history and geomorphic processes underpinning topographic diversity across landscapes. ACD also exhibited spatial autocorrelation, which may reflect biological processes that influence ACD, such as the assembly of species or phenotypes across the landscape, but additional research is needed to resolve how abiotic and biotic factors contribute to ACD variation across high biomass, high diversity tropical landscapes.","author":[{"family":"Taylor","given":"Philip"},{"family":"Asner","given":"Gregory"},{"family":"Dahlin","given":"Kyla"},{"family":"Anderson","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Knapp","given":"David"},{"family":"Martin","given":"Roberta"},{"family":"Mascaro","given":"Joseph"},{"family":"Chazdon","given":"Robin"},{"family":"Cole","given":"Rebecca"},{"family":"Wanek","given":"Wolfgang"},{"family":"Hofhansl","given":"Florian"},{"family":"Malavassi","given":"Edgar"},{"family":"Vilchez-Alvarado","given":"Braulio"},{"family":"Townsend","given":"Alan"}],"citation-key":"taylorLandscapescaleControlsAboveground2015","container-title":"PLoS One","DOI":"10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0126748","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",6,10]]},"title":"Landscape-scale controls on aboveground forest carbon stocks on the Osa Peninsula, Costa Rica","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0126748","volume":"10"},

However, the effects of longer-term climate variability on tropical forest carbon dynamics are still not well understood. We synthesised ﬁeld data from more than 150 tropical forest sites to explore how climate regulates tropical forest aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) and organic matter decomposition, and combined those data with two existing databases to explore climate – C relationships globally. While previous analyses have focused on the effects of either temperature or rainfall on ANPP, our results highlight the importance of interactions between temperature and rainfall on the C cycle. In cool forests (< 20 °C), high rainfall slowed rates of C cycling, but in warm tropical forests (> 20 °C) it consistently enhanced both ANPP and decomposition. At the global scale, our analysis showed an increase in ANPP with rainfall in relatively warm sites, inconsistent with declines in ANPP with rainfall reported previously. Overall, our results alter our understanding of climate – C cycle relationships, with high precipitation accelerating rates of C exchange with the atmosphere in the most productive biome on earth.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Taylor","given":"Philip G."},{"family":"Cleveland","given":"Cory C."},{"family":"Wieder","given":"William R."},{"family":"Sullivan","given":"Benjamin W."},{"family":"Doughty","given":"Christopher E."},{"family":"Dobrowski","given":"Solomon Z."},{"family":"Townsend","given":"Alan R."}],"citation-key":"taylorTemperatureRainfallInteract2017","container-title":"Ecology Letters","container-title-short":"Ecol Lett","DOI":"10.1111/ele.12765","editor":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Lingli"}],"ISSN":"1461-023X, 1461-0248","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",6]]},"language":"en","page":"779-788","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Temperature and rainfall interact to control carbon cycling in tropical forests","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.12765","volume":"20"},

Many eCO2 experiments suggest that nutrient limitations modulate the local magnitude of the eCO2 effect on plant biomass1,3,5, but the global extent of these limitations has not been empirically quantified, complicating projections of the capacity of plants to take up CO27,8. Here, we present a data-driven global quantification of the eCO2 effect on biomass based on 138 eCO2 experiments. The strength of CO2 fertilization is primarily driven by nitrogen (N) in ~65% of global vegetation and by phosphorus (P) in ~25% of global vegetation, with N- or P-limitation modulated by mycorrhizal association. Our approach suggests that CO2 levels expected by 2100 can potentially enhance plant biomass by 12 ± 3% above current values, equivalent to 59 ± 13 PgC. The future effect of eCO2 we derive from experiments is geographically consistent with past changes in greenness9, but is considerably lower than the past effect derived from models10.

  {"id":"tersteegeBiasedcorrectedRichnessEstimates2020","abstract":"Amazonian forests are extraordinarily diverse, but the estimated species richness is very much debated. Here, we apply an ensemble of parametric estimators and a novel technique that includes conspecific spatial aggregation to an extended database of forest plots with up-to-date taxonomy. We show that the species abundance distribution of Amazonia is best approximated by a logseries with aggregated individuals, where aggregation increases with rarity. By averaging several methods to estimate total richness, we confirm that over 15,000 tree species are expected to occur in Amazonia. We also show that using ten times the number of plots would result in an increase to just ~50% of those 15,000 estimated species. To get a more complete sample of all tree species, rigorous field campaigns may be needed but the number of trees in Amazonia will remain an estimate for years to come.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Steege","given":"Hans","non-dropping-particle":"ter"},{"family":"Prado","given":"Paulo I."},{"family":"Lima","given":"Renato A.

Here, we provide empirical data on the commonness, rarity, and richness of lowland tree species across the entire Amazon Basin and Guiana Shield (Amazonia), collected in 1170 tree plots in all major forest types. Extrapolations suggest that Amazonia harbors roughly 16,000 tree species, of which just 227 (1.4%) account for half of all trees. Most of these are habitat specialists and only dominant in one or two regions of the basin. We discuss some implications of the finding that a small group of species—less diverse than the North American tree flora—accounts for half of the world’s most diverse tree community.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Steege","given":"Hans","non-dropping-particle":"ter"},{"family":"Pitman","given":"Nigel C.

  {"id":"tersteegeMappingDensityDiversity2023","abstract":"Using 2.046 botanically-inventoried tree plots across the largest tropical forest on Earth, we mapped tree species-diversity and tree species-richness at 0.1-degree resolution, and investigated drivers for diversity and richness. Using only location, stratified by forest type, as predictor, our spatial model, to the best of our knowledge, provides the most accurate map of tree diversity in Amazonia to date, explaining approximately 70% of the tree diversity and species-richness. Large soil-forest combinations determine a significant percentage of the variation in tree species-richness and tree alpha-diversity in Amazonian forest-plots. We suggest that the size and fragmentation of these systems drive their large-scale diversity patterns and hence local diversity. A model not using location but cumulative water deficit, tree density, and temperature seasonality explains 47% of the tree species-richness in the terra-firme forest in Amazonia. Over large areas across Amazonia, residuals of this relationship are small and poorly spatially structured, suggesting that much of the residual variation may be local. The Guyana Shield area has consistently negative residuals, showing that this area has lower tree species-richness than expected by our models. We provide extensive plot meta-data, including tree density, tree alpha-diversity and tree species-richness results and gridded maps at 0.1-degree resolution.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Steege","given":"Hans","non-dropping-particle":"ter"},{"family":"Pitman","given":"Nigel C.

  {"id":"teskeUsingLandsatBurned2021","abstract":"Development of comprehensive spatially explicit ﬁre occurrence data remains one of the most critical needs for ﬁre managers globally, and especially for conservation across the southeastern United States. Not only are many endangered species and ecosystems in that region reliant on frequent ﬁre, but ﬁre risk analysis, prescribed ﬁre planning, and ﬁre behavior modeling are sensitive to ﬁre history due to the long growing season and high vegetation productivity. Spatial data that map burned areas over time provide critical information for evaluating management successes. However, existing ﬁre data have undocumented shortcomings that limit their use when detailing the effectiveness of ﬁre management at state and regional scales. Here, we assessed information in existing ﬁre datasets for Florida and the Landsat Burned Area products based on input from the ﬁre management community. We considered the potential of different datasets to track the spatial extents of ﬁres and derive ﬁre history metrics (e.g., time since last burn, ﬁre frequency, and seasonality). We found that burned areas generated by applying a 90% threshold to the Landsat burn probability product matched patterns recorded and observed by ﬁre managers at three pilot areas. We then created ﬁre history metrics for the entire state from the modiﬁed Landsat Burned Area product. Finally, to show their potential application for conservation management, we compared ﬁre history metrics across ownerships for natural pinelands, where prescribed ﬁre is frequently applied. Implications of this effort include increased awareness around conservation and ﬁre management planning efforts and an extension of derivative products regionally or globally.","author":[{"family":"Teske","given":"Casey"},{"family":"Vanderhoof","given":"Melanie K."},{"family":"Hawbaker","given":"Todd J."},{"family":"Noble","given":"Joe"},{"family":"Hiers","given":"John Kevin"}],"citation-key":"teskeUsingLandsatBurned2021","container-title":"Fire","DOI":"10.3390/fire4020026","ISSN":"2571-6255","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"page":"26","title":"Using the Landsat Burned Area Products to Derive Fire History Relevant for Fire Management and Conservation in the State of Florida, Southeastern USA","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2571-6255/4/2/26","volume":"4"},

Over the past five decades, remote-sensing techniques have played a vital role in forest AGB estimation at different scales. Here, we present an overview of the progress in remote sensing-based forest AGB estimation. More in detail, we first describe the principles of remote sensing techniques in forest AGB estimation: that is, the construction and use of parameters associated with AGB (rather than the direct measurement of AGB values). Second, we review forest AGB remotely sensed data sources (including passive optical, microwave, and LiDAR) and methods (e.g., empirical, physical, mechanistic, and comprehensive models) alongside their limitations and advantages. Third, we discuss possible sources of uncertainty in resultant forest AGB estimates, including those associated with remote sensing imagery, sample plot survey data, stand structure, and statistical models. Finally, we offer forward-looking perspectives and insights on prospective research directions for remote sensing-based forest AGB estimation. Remote sensing is anticipated to play an increasingly important role in future forest AGB estimation and carbon cycle studies. Overall, this comprehensive review may (1) benefit the research communities focused on carbon cycle, remote sensing, and climate change elucidation, (2) provide a theoretical basis for the study of the carbon cycle and global climate change, (3) inform forest ecosystems and carbon management, and (4) aid in the elucidation of forest feedbacks to climate change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Tian","given":"Lei"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Xiaocan"},{"family":"Tao","given":"Yu"},{"family":"Li","given":"Mingyang"},{"family":"Qian","given":"Chunhua"},{"family":"Liao","given":"Longtao"},{"family":"Fu","given":"Wenxue"}],"citation-key":"tianReviewRemoteSensingBased2023","container-title":"Forests","DOI":"10.3390/f14061086","ISSN":"1999-4907","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",6]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"6","page":"1086","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Review of Remote Sensing-Based Methods for Forest Aboveground Biomass Estimation: Progress, Challenges, and Prospects","title-short":"Review of Remote Sensing-Based Methods for Forest Aboveground Biomass Estimation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/14/6/1086","volume":"14"},

If, as hypothesized, plants specialized on low-nutrient habitats are relatively short in height, short-lived, and fast growing, and if they reproduce early in life compared to plants dominant when light at the soil surface is limiting, these life history differences could explain the similarity of secondary succession on rich soils to primary succession and secondary succession on poor soils.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Tilman","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"tilmanResourceRatioHypothesisPlant1985","container-title":"The American Naturalist","DOI":"10.1086/284382","ISSN":"0003-0147","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["1985",6]]},"page":"827-852","publisher":"The University of Chicago Press","source":"journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","title":"The Resource-Ratio Hypothesis of Plant Succession","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/284382","volume":"125"},

Changes in vegetation structure and species composition were analyzed in secondary forests following swidden agriculture in a semideciduous forest of Bolivian lowlands. Twenty-eight fallows, stratiﬁed by four successional stages (early = 1–5 yr, intermediate = 6–10 yr, advanced = 12–20 yr, and older = 22–36 yr), and ten stands of mature forests were sampled. The overstory (plants ≥5 cm diameter at breast height [DBH]) was sampled using a 20 × 50 m plot and the understory (plants <5 cm DBH) in three nested 2 × 5 m subplots. Semistructured interviews provided information on fallow management. Canopy height, basal area, and liana density of the overstory increased with secondary forest age. The early stage had the lowest species density and diversity in the overstory, but the highest diversity in the understory. Species composition and abundance differentiated mature forests and early successional stage from other successional stages; however, species showed individualistic responses across the temporal gradient. A total of 123 of 280 species were useful with edible, medicinal, and construction plants being the most abundant for both over- and understories. Most of Los Gwarayo preferred mature forests for making new swidden, while fallows were valuable for crops, useful species, and regenerating timber species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Toledo","given":"Marisol"},{"family":"Salick","given":"Jan"}],"citation-key":"toledoSecondarySuccessionIndigenous2006","container-title":"Biotropica","DOI":"10.1111/j.1744-7429.2006.00120.x","ISSN":"00063606","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",3]]},"language":"en","page":"161-170","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Secondary Succession and Indigenous Management in Semideciduous Forest Fallows of the Amazon Basin","title-short":"Secondary Succession and Indigenous Management in Semideciduous Forest Fallows of the Amazon Basin <sup>1</sup>","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1744-7429.2006.00120.x","volume":"38"},

  {"id":"townsendControlsFoliarRatios2007","abstract":"Correlations between foliar nutrient concentrations and soil nutrient availability have been found in multiple ecosystems. These relationships have led to the use of foliar nutrients as an index of nutrient status and to the prediction of broadscale patterns in ecosystem processes. More recently, a growing interest in ecological stoichiometry has fueled multiple analyses of foliar nitrogen : phosphorus (N:P) ratios within and across ecosystems. These studies have observed that N:P values are generally elevated in tropical forests when compared to higher latitude ecosystems, adding weight to a common belief that tropical forests are generally N rich and P poor. However, while these broad generalizations may have merit, their simplicity masks the enormous environmental heterogeneity that exists within the tropics; such variation includes large ranges in soil fertility and climate, as well as the highest plant species diversity of any biome. Here we present original data on foliar N and P concentrations from 150 mature canopy tree species in Costa Rica and Brazil, and combine those data with a comprehensive new literature synthesis to explore the major sources of variation in foliar N:P values within the tropics. We found no relationship between N:P ratios and either latitude or mean annual precipitation within the tropics alone. There is, however, evidence of seasonal controls; in our Costa Rica sites, foliar N:P values differed by 25% between wet and dry seasons. The N:P ratios do vary with soil P availability and/or soil order, but there is substantial overlap across coarse divisions in soil type, and perhaps the most striking feature of the data set is variation at the species level. Taken as a whole, our results imply that the dominant influence on foliar N:P ratios in the tropics is species variability and that, unlike marine systems and perhaps many other terrestrial biomes, the N:P stoichiometry of tropical forests is not well constrained. Thus any use of N:P ratios in the tropics to infer larger-scale ecosystem processes must comprehensively account for the diversity of any given site and recognize the broad range in nutrient requirements, even at the local scale.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Townsend","given":"Alan R."},{"family":"Cleveland","given":"Cory C."},{"family":"Asner","given":"Gregory P."},{"family":"Bustamante","given":"Mercedes M.

  {"id":"tschakertIndigenousLivelihoodsSlashandburn2007","abstract":"Improved crop–fallow systems in the humid tropics can simultaneously sequester atmospheric carbon emissions and contribute to sustainable livelihoods of rural populations. A study with an indigenous community in eastern Panama revealed a considerable biophysical potential for carbon offsets in small-scale slash-and-burn agriculture through longer fallow periods, improved fallow management, secondary forest development, and agricultural intensification. Based on soil and biomass carbon measurements, estimated annual sequestration rates amount to 0.3−3.7 t C ha− 1 yr− 1. Despite such potential, the economic benefits of initiatives aimed at sequestration of carbon in the community are likely to be rather unequally distributed within the community. Heterogeneity in livelihood strategies and uneven asset endowments among households –factors often overlooked in the ongoing carbon and sustainable development debate – are expected to strongly affect household participation. Indeed, only the better-endowed households that have also managed to diversify into more lucrative farm and non-farm activities are likely to be able to participate in and thus benefit from improved crop–fallow systems that capture carbon.

  {"id":"tscharntkeLandscapeModerationBiodiversity2012","abstract":"Understanding how landscape characteristics affect biodiversity patterns and ecological processes at local and landscape scales is critical for mitigating effects of global environmental change. In this review, we use knowledge gained from human-modified landscapes to suggest eight hypotheses, which we hope will encourage more systematic research on the role of landscape composition and configuration in determining the structure of ecological communities, ecosystem functioning and services. We organize the eight hypotheses under four overarching themes. Section A: ‘landscape moderation of biodiversity patterns' includes (1) the landscape species pool hypothesis—the size of the landscape-wide species pool moderates local (alpha) biodiversity, and (2) the dominance of beta diversity hypothesis—landscape-moderated dissimilarity of local communities determines landscape-wide biodiversity and overrides negative local effects of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity. Section B: ‘landscape moderation of population dynamics' includes (3) the cross-habitat spillover hypothesis—landscape-moderated spillover of energy, resources and organisms across habitats, including between managed and natural ecosystems, influences landscape-wide community structure and associated processes and (4) the landscape-moderated concentration and dilution hypothesis—spatial and temporal changes in landscape composition can cause transient concentration or dilution of populations with functional consequences. Section C: ‘landscape moderation of functional trait selection’ includes (5) the landscape-moderated functional trait selection hypothesis—landscape moderation of species trait selection shapes the functional role and trajectory of community assembly, and (6) the landscape-moderated insurance hypothesis—landscape complexity provides spatial and temporal insurance, i.e. high resilience and stability of ecological processes in changing environments. Section D: ‘landscape constraints on conservation management' includes (7) the intermediate landscape-complexity hypothesis—landscape-moderated effectiveness of local conservation management is highest in structurally simple, rather than in cleared (i.e. extremely simplified) or in complex landscapes, and (8) the landscape-moderated biodiversity versus ecosystem service management hypothesis—landscape-moderated biodiversity conservation to optimize functional diversity and related ecosystem services will not protect endangered species. Shifting our research focus from local to landscape-moderated effects on biodiversity will be critical to developing solutions for future biodiversity and ecosystem service management.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Tscharntke","given":"Teja"},{"family":"Tylianakis","given":"Jason M."},{"family":"Rand","given":"Tatyana A."},{"family":"Didham","given":"Raphael K."},{"family":"Fahrig","given":"Lenore"},{"family":"Batáry","given":"Péter"},{"family":"Bengtsson","given":"Janne"},{"family":"Clough","given":"Yann"},{"family":"Crist","given":"Thomas O."},{"family":"Dormann","given":"Carsten F."},{"family":"Ewers","given":"Robert M."},{"family":"Fründ","given":"Jochen"},{"family":"Holt","given":"Robert D."},{"family":"Holzschuh","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Klein","given":"Alexandra M."},{"family":"Kleijn","given":"David"},{"family":"Kremen","given":"Claire"},{"family":"Landis","given":"Doug A."},{"family":"Laurance","given":"William"},{"family":"Lindenmayer","given":"David"},{"family":"Scherber","given":"Christoph"},{"family":"Sodhi","given":"Navjot"},{"family":"Steffan-Dewenter","given":"Ingolf"},{"family":"Thies","given":"Carsten"},{"family":"Putten","given":"Wim H.","non-dropping-particle":"van der"},{"family":"Westphal","given":"Catrin"}],"citation-key":"tscharntkeLandscapeModerationBiodiversity2012","container-title":"Biological Reviews","DOI":"10.1111/j.1469-185X.2011.00216.x","ISSN":"1469-185X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2012 The Authors.

Given that ecosystems provide services that are valued by humans, this inevitably suggests that the loss of species from natural ecosystems could diminish their value. This raises two important questions. First, will experimental results translate into the real world, where species are being lost at an alarming rate? And second, what are the benefits and pitfalls of such valuation exercises? We argue that the empirical results obtained in experiments are entirely consistent with well-established theories of species coexistence. We then examine the current body of work through the lens of niche theory and highlight where closer links with theory could open up opportunities for future research. We argue that niche theory predicts that diversity–functioning relationships are likely to be stronger (and require more species) in the field than in simplified experimental settings. However, we caution that while many of the biological processes that promote coexistence can also generate diversity–function relationships, there is no simple mapping between the two.

  {"id":"uhlAbandonedPasturesEastern1988","abstract":"(1) Vegetation composition, structure, and biomass accumulation were studied on thirteen forest sites that had been cut and burned, used as cattle pasture, and then abandoned in the eastern Amazon near Paragominas, Para, Brazil. (2) the study sites were of two ages (two to four years and seven to eight years) and had received light, medium or heavy use for up to thirteen years. (3) Forest regenerated vigorously on sites of previously light use. Above-ground biomass accumulation averaged 10 t ha-1 y -1 or 80 t after years (roughly one-quarter of mature forest levels). Tree species richness was also high (about 20 per 100 m2) and almost all species also occurred in native forest. Moderately gazed pastures also developed forest but biomass accumulation was only 5 t ha-1 y-1. Tree species richness was also lower than on light-use sites and there were fewer forest trees. Abandoned pastures subjected to heavy use had the least distinct patterns of succession. the single eight-year-old site was dominated by grasses and forbs with fewer than one tree per 100 m2 and an above-ground biomass accumulation of 0.6 t ha-1 y-1, a value only about 6% of that found on light-use sites. (4) The light-use sites had significantly higher biomass and species richness in both age-classes than lighter moderate- or heavy-use sites. Site age was a good predictor of above-ground biomass accumulation on light-and moderate-use sites, but not on heavy-use sites. (5) These Amazon ecosystems generally can recover after large-scale pasture disturbances. Only where land has been used too intensively for long periods is reforestation uncertain, but probably less than 10% of the pasture land in northern Para has degraded to this level. Nevertheless, the re-growth forest, regardless of pasture-use history, will not necessarily have the same characteristics of physiogonomy or species composition as that originally occupying the site. Moreover, as burning becomes more prevalent in eastern Amazonia, abandoned sites may not develop into forest and the irreversible degradation of the entire regional ecosystem must be contemplated.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Uhl","given":"C."},{"family":"Buschbacher","given":"R."},{"family":"Serrao","given":"E.

However, unless the causes of deforestation are addressed, reforestation efforts will be in vain. The link between deforestation and reforestation operates within the domain of human intervention on the landscape, and includes the patterns of land resource use and access. This review considers the role that land and tree tenure (resource use and access) of agroforestry can have in reducing both the rate of conversion of forest to agriculture – the largest biotic emission of carbon – and forest degradation; thereby allowing both natural forests and reforestation to participate in carbon uptake. The operational land use and tenure aspects of agroforestry, and the impacts of these on deforestation, and in overcoming the obstacles to large scale reforestation, are presented.

  {"id":"vance-chalcraftRelationshipAbovegroundBiomass2010","abstract":"Anthropogenic activities have accelerated the rate of global loss of biodiversity, making it more important than ever to understand the structure of biodiversity hotspots. One current focus is the relationship between species richness and aboveground biomass (AGB) in a variety of ecosystems. Nonetheless, species diversity, evenness, rarity, or dominance represent other critical attributes of biodiversity and may have associations with AGB that are markedly different than that of species richness. Using data from large trees in four environmentally similar sites in the Luquillo Experimental Forest of Puerto Rico, we determined the shape and strength of relationships between each of five measures of biodiversity (i.e., species richness, Simpson's diversity, Simpson's evenness, rarity, and dominance) and AGB. We quantified these measures of biodiversity using either proportional biomass or proportional abundance as weighting factors. Three of the four sites had a unimodal relationship between species richness and AGB, with only the most mature site evincing a positive, linear relationship. The differences between the mature site and the other sites, as well as the differences between our richness-AGB relationships and those found at other forest sites, highlight the crucial role that prior land use and severe storms have on this forest community. Although the shape and strength of relationships differed greatly among measures of biodiversity and among sites, the strongest relationships within each site were always those involving richness or evenness. © 2009 The Author(s).

Trees (whole community) with null or negative growth had a higher mortality, although this effect was not significant for individual species. Growth patterns were consistent along consecutive periods of evaluation for canopy species, but not for understory species. Canopy species had higher and more variable growth rates than understory species, which we attribute to greater access to light at the canopy level and also to a wider range of light conditions experienced during growth. Canopy species and one understory species, T. emarginata, showed accelerated growth as they became larger.

Using a new conceptual model, we show how critical alterations in plant–soil feedback interactions can change the assemblage of plant communities. We highlight recent advances, define terms and identify future challenges in this area of research and discuss how variations in strengths and directions of plant–soil feedbacks can explain succession, invasion, response to climate warming and diversity-productivity relationships. While there has been a rapid increase in understanding the biological, chemical and physical mechanisms and their interdependencies underlying plant–soil feedback interactions, further progress is to be expected from applying new experimental techniques and technologies, linking empirical studies to modelling and field-based studies that can include plant–soil feedback interactions on longer time scales that also include long-term processes such as litter decomposition and mineralization. Significant progress has also been made in analysing consequences of plant–soil feedbacks for biodiversity-functioning relationships, plant fitness and selection. To further integrate plant–soil feedbacks into ecological theory, it will be important to determine where and how observed patterns may be generalized, and how they may influence evolution. Synthesis. Gaining a greater understanding of plant–soil feedbacks and underlying mechanisms is improving our ability to predict consequences of these interactions for plant community composition and productivity under a variety of conditions.

  {"id":"vandersandeSoilResistanceRecovery2023","abstract":"The recovery of soil conditions is crucial for successful ecosystem restoration and, hence, for achieving the goals of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration. Here, we assess how soils resist forest conversion and agricultural land use, and how soils recover during subsequent tropical forest succession on abandoned agricultural fields. Our overarching question is how soil resistance and recovery depend on local conditions such as climate, soil type and land-use history. For 300 plots in 21 sites across the Neotropics, we used a chronosequence approach in which we sampled soils from two depths in old-growth forests, agricultural fields (i.e. crop fields and pastures), and secondary forests that differ in age (1–95 years) since abandonment. We measured six soil properties using a standardized sampling design and laboratory analyses. Soil resistance strongly depended on local conditions. Croplands and sites on high-activity clay (i.e. high fertility) show strong increases in bulk density and decreases in pH, carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) during deforestation and subsequent agricultural use. Resistance is lower in such sites probably because of a sharp decline in fine root biomass in croplands in the upper soil layers, and a decline in litter input from formerly productive old-growth forest (on high-activity clays). Soil recovery also strongly depended on local conditions. During forest succession, high-activity clays and croplands decreased most strongly in bulk density and increased in C and N, possibly because of strongly compacted soils with low C and N after cropland abandonment, and because of rapid vegetation recovery in high-activity clays leading to greater fine root growth and litter input. Furthermore, sites at low precipitation decreased in pH, whereas sites at high precipitation increased in N and decreased in C : N ratio. Extractable phosphorus (P) did not recover during succession, suggesting increased P limitation as forests age. These results indicate that no single solution exists for effective soil restoration and that local site conditions should determine the restoration strategies.\n            This article is part of the theme issue ‘Understanding forest landscape restoration: reinforcing scientific foundations for the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration’.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Van Der Sande","given":"Masha T."},{"family":"Powers","given":"Jennifer S."},{"family":"Kuyper","given":"Thom W."},{"family":"Norden","given":"Natalia"},{"family":"Salgado-Negret","given":"Beatriz"},{"family":"Silva De Almeida","given":"Jarcilene"},{"family":"Bongers","given":"Frans"},{"family":"Delgado","given":"Diego"},{"family":"Dent","given":"Daisy H."},{"family":"Derroire","given":"Géraldine"},{"family":"Do Espirito Santo","given":"Mario Marcos"},{"family":"Dupuy","given":"Juan Manuel"},{"family":"Fernandes","given":"Geraldo Wilson"},{"family":"Finegan","given":"Bryan"},{"family":"Gavito","given":"Mayra E."},{"family":"Hernández-Stefanoni","given":"José Luis"},{"family":"Jakovac","given":"Catarina C."},{"family":"Jones","given":"Isabel L."},{"family":"Das Dores Magalhães Veloso","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Meave","given":"Jorge A."},{"family":"Mora","given":"Francisco"},{"family":"Muñoz","given":"Rodrigo"},{"family":"Pérez-Cárdenas","given":"Nathalia"},{"family":"Piotto","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Álvarez-Dávila","given":"Esteban"},{"family":"Caceres-Siani","given":"Yasmani"},{"family":"Dalban-Pilon","given":"Coralie"},{"family":"Dourdain","given":"Aurélie"},{"family":"Du","given":"Dan V."},{"family":"García Villalobos","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Nunes","given":"Yule Roberta Ferreira"},{"family":"Sanchez-Azofeifa","given":"Arturo"},{"family":"Poorter","given":"Lourens"}],"citation-key":"vandersandeSoilResistanceRecovery2023","container-title":"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","container-title-short":"Phil.

However, deforestation of tropical forest, with a net rate of 5.5 million hectares annually in 2010–2015, profoundly impacts soil properties and functions. Reforestation is also prominent in the tropics, again altering the state and functioning of the underlying soils. In this Review, we discuss the substantial changes in dynamic soil properties following deforestation and during reforestation. Changes associated with deforestation continue for decades after forest clearing eventually extend to deep subsoils and strongly affect soil functions, including nutrient storage and recycling, carbon storage and greenhouse gas emissions, erosion resistance and water storage, drainage and filtration. Reforestation reverses many of the effects of deforestation, mainly in the topsoil, but such restoration can take decades and the resulting soil properties still deviate from those under natural forests. Improved management of soil organic matter in converted land uses can moderate or reduce the ecologically deleterious effects of deforestation on soils. We emphasize the importance of soil knowledge not only in cross-disciplinary research on deforestation and reforestation but also in developing effective incentives and policies to reduce deforestation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Veldkamp","given":"Edzo"},{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Marcus"},{"family":"Powers","given":"Jennifer S."},{"family":"Corre","given":"Marife D."}],"citation-key":"veldkampDeforestationReforestationImpacts2020","container-title":"Nature Reviews Earth & Environment","container-title-short":"Nat Rev Earth Environ","DOI":"10.1038/s43017-020-0091-5","ISSN":"2662-138X","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",11]]},"language":"en","license":"2020 Springer Nature Limited","number":"11","page":"590-605","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www-nature-com.proxy3.library.mcgill.ca","title":"Deforestation and reforestation impacts on soils in the tropics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-020-0091-5","volume":"1"},

  {"id":"vieiraClassifyingSuccessionalForests2003","abstract":"Secondary forests may become increasingly important as temporary reservoirs of genetic diversity, stocks of carbon and nutrients, and moderators of hydrologic cycles in the Amazon Basin as agricultural lands are abandoned and often later cleared again for agriculture. We studied a municipality in northeastern Para´, Brazil, that has been settled for over a century and where numerous cycles of slash and burn agriculture have occurred. The forests were grouped into young (3 – 6 years), intermediate (10 – 20 years), advanced (40 – 70 years), and mature successional stages using 1999 Landsat 7 ETM imagery. Supervised classification of the imagery showed that these forest classes occupied 22%, 13%, 9%, and 6% of the area, respectively. Although this area underwent widespread deforestation many decades ago, forest of some type covers about 50% of the area. Row crops, tree crops, and pastures cover 8%, 20%, and 22%, respectively. The best separation among land covers appeared in a plot of NDVI versus band 5 reflectance. The same groupings of successional forests were derived independently from indices of similarity among tree species composition. Measured distributions of tree height and diameter also covaried with these successional classes, with the young forests having nearly uniform distributions, whereas multiple height and diameter classes were present in the advanced successional forests. Biomass accumulated more slowly in this secondary forest chronosequence than has been reported for other areas, which explains why the 70-year-old forests here were still distinguishable from mature forests using spectral properties. Rates of forest regrowth may vary across regions due to differences in edaphic, climatic, and historical land-use factors, thus rendering most relationships among spectral properties and forest age site-specific. Successional status, as characterized by species composition, biomass, and distributions of heights and diameters, may be superior to stand age as a means of stratifying these forests for characterization of spectral properties.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Vieira","given":"I"}],"citation-key":"vieiraClassifyingSuccessionalForests2003","container-title":"Remote Sensing of Environment","container-title-short":"Remote Sensing of Environment","DOI":"10.1016/j.rse.2002.09.002","ISSN":"00344257","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",11,15]]},"language":"en","page":"470-481","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Classifying successional forests using Landsat spectral properties and ecological characteristics in eastern Amazônia","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0034425703002062","volume":"87"},

We present a global meta-analysis of 199 articles reporting 1041 field studies that in total describe the impacts of 135 alien plant taxa on resident species, communities and ecosystems. Across studies, alien plants had a significant effect in 11 of 24 different types of impact assessed. The magnitude and direction of the impact varied both within and between different types of impact. On average, abundance and diversity of the resident species decreased in invaded sites, whereas primary production and several ecosystem processes were enhanced. While alien N-fixing species had greater impacts on N-cycling variables, they did not consistently affect other impact types. The magnitude of the impacts was not significantly different between island and mainland ecosystems. Overall, alien species impacts are heterogeneous and not unidirectional even within particular impact types.

In general, lowland tropical forests have more nitrogen and lower dry mass/nitrogen ratios in litterfall than most temperate forests, while nitrogen return in montane tropical forests is comparable to that in temperate forests. Calcium return is also high in most tropical forests studied, but many tropical forests (lowland and montane) have little phosphorus return and very high dry mass/phosphorus ratios in litterfall compared to most temperate forests. Phosphorus appears to be cycled highly efficiently in such forests. Fine litterfall in the range of tropical forests studied was predicted from climate, and the residuals of this regression were positively correlated with phosphorus but not nitrogen concentrations in litterfall. The amount of fine litterfall (uncorrected for climate) was also significantly correlated with phosphorus concentrations in moist and wet lowland tropical forests.

  {"id":"vitousekNitrogenLimitationLand1991","abstract":"The widespread occurrence of nitrogen limitation to net primary production in terrestrial and marine ecosystems is something of a puzzle; it would seem that nitrogen fixers should have a substantial competitive advantage wherever nitrogen is limiting, and that their activity in turn should reverse limitation. Nevertheless, there is substantial evidence that nitrogen limits net primary production much of the time in most terrestrial biomes and many marine ecosystems. We examine both how the biogeochemistry of the nitrogen cycle could cause limitation to develop, and how nitrogen limitation could persist as a consequence of processes that prevent or reduce nitrogen fixation. Biogeochemical mechansism that favor nitrogen limitation include: - the substantial mobility of nitrogen across ecosystem boundaries, which favors nitogen limitation in the “source” ecosystem - especially where denitrification is important in sediments and soils, or in terrestrial ecosystems where fire is frequent; - differences in the biochemistry of nitrogen as opposed to phosphorus (with detrital N mostly carbon-bonded and detrital P mostly ester-bonded), which favor the development of nitrogen limitation where decomposition is slow, and allow the development of a positive feedback from nitrogen limitation to producers, to reduced decomposition of their detritus, and on to reduced nitrogen availability; and - other more specialized, but perhaps no less important, processes. A number of mechanisms could keep nitrogen fixation from reversing nitrogen limitation. These include: - energetic constraints on the colonization or activity of nitrogen fixers; - limitation of nitrogen fixers or fixation by another nutrient (phosphorus, molybdenum, or iron) - which would then represent the ultimate factor limiting net primary production; - other physical and ecological mechanisms. The possible importance of these and other processes is discussed for a wide range of terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Vitousek","given":"PeterM."},{"family":"Howarth","given":"RobertW."}],"citation-key":"vitousekNitrogenLimitationLand1991","container-title":"Biogeochemistry","container-title-short":"Biogeochemistry","DOI":"10.1007/BF00002772","ISSN":"0168-2563, 1573-515X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1991"]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Nitrogen limitation on land and in the sea: How can it occur?","title-short":"Nitrogen limitation on land and in the sea","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/BF00002772","volume":"13"},

Growth trajectories of 205 individual trees from 54 neotropical species censused every 2 months over a 4-year period were used to rank 9 climate variables and find the best predictive model.

Relative extractable water was the main predictor and alone explained more than 60% of the climate effect on tree growth, i.e. 5.4% of the individual variation in tree growth. Furthermore, the global annual tree growth was more dependent on the diameter increment at the onset of the rain season than on the duration of dry season. N The best predictive model included 3 climate variables: relative extractable water, minimum temperature and irradiance. The root mean squared error of prediction (0.035 mm.d–1) was slightly above the mean value of the growth (0.026 mm.d–1). N Amongst climate variables, we highlight the predominant role of water availability in determining seasonal variation in tree growth of neotropical forest trees and the need to include these relationships in forest simulators to test, in silico, the impact of different climate scenarios on the future dynamics of the rainforest.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Wagner","given":"Fabien"},{"family":"Rossi","given":"Vivien"},{"family":"Stahl","given":"Clément"},{"family":"Bonal","given":"Damien"},{"family":"Hérault","given":"Bruno"}],"citation-key":"wagnerWaterAvailabilityMain2012","container-title":"PLoS ONE","container-title-short":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0034074","editor":[{"family":"Bohrer","given":"Gil"}],"ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",4,10]]},"language":"en","page":"e34074","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Water Availability Is the Main Climate Driver of Neotropical Tree Growth","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0034074","volume":"7"},
  {"id":"walkerCapturingEphemeralForest2020","abstract":"Measuring and progressing toward international goals of curbing deforestation and improving livelihoods of people who depend on forests requires nuanced understanding of forests and the processes surrounding deforestation and degradation. Despite rapid improvements in Earth Observation technology, monitoring of tropical forests remains hindered by persistent cloud cover, heterogeneous landscapes, long wet seasons, and small and ephemeral clearings masked by rapid growth. A hybrid method is presented that combines elements of both time-series and compositing approaches to best overcome these obstacles to map forest cover and change in the Republic of Panama based on Landsat imagery. The resulting Panama Vegetation-Cover Time-Series (PVCTS) maps depict forest cover in Panama from 1990 to 2016 at 30 m resolution. Acknowledging the fuzzy boundary between forest and non-forest classes, these maps employ a hierarchical classification scheme that reflects the natural process of regeneration and can accommodate different definitions of forest and deforestation. Classification accuracy is 97–98 % between forest/non-forest categories and 76–81 % for deforestation events. The maps show a slight greening of Panama from 1990 to 2016 caused by expansion of young secondary growth. The annual rate of deforestation in mature forest has remained around -0.6 %/yr, although young forests have matured at a similar rate such that there is no net loss of forest. While estimates of total forest cover are similar to official national estimates depending on forest definition, there is little agreement in location of deforestation events.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Walker","given":"Kendra"}],"citation-key":"walkerCapturingEphemeralForest2020","container-title":"International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation","container-title-short":"International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation","DOI":"10.1016/j.jag.2019.102029","ISSN":"03032434","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",5]]},"language":"en","page":"102029","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Capturing ephemeral forest dynamics with hybrid time-series and composite mapping in the Republic of Panama","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0303243419306221","volume":"87"},

Here we analyse the four decade-long CO2-enrichment experiments in woody ecosystems that measured total NPP and biomass. CO2 enrichment increased biomass increment by 1.05 ± 0.26 kg C m−2 over a full decade, a 29.1 ± 11.7% stimulation of biomass gain in these early-secondary-succession temperate ecosystems. This response is predictable by combining the CO2 response of NPP (0.16 ± 0.03 kg C m−2 y−1) and the CO2-independent, linear slope between biomass increment and cumulative NPP (0.55 ± 0.17). An ensemble of terrestrial ecosystem models fail to predict both terms correctly.

To effectively determine where and how to act, jurisdictions need robust data illustrating the magnitude and distribution of opportunities to increase carbon storage, as well as information on the actions available to achieve that storage. Here, we provide globally consistent maps for directing additional carbon storage under current and future climate, as well as a framework for determining how that storage could be gained through restoration, improved management, or maintenance of woody biomass and soil organic matter. Our estimates provide an upper bound on how improved land stewardship can mitigate the climate crisis.\n          , \n            \n              Constraining the climate crisis requires urgent action to reduce anthropogenic emissions while simultaneously removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

We also provide a framework for prioritizing actions related to the restoration, management, and maintenance of woody carbon stocks and associated soils. By comparing current to potential carbon storage, while excluding areas critical to food production and human habitation, we find 287 petagrams (PgC) of unrealized potential storage opportunity, of which 78% (224 PgC) is in biomass and 22% (63 PgC) is in soil. Improved management of existing forests may offer nearly three-fourths (206 PgC) of the total unrealized potential, with the majority (71%) concentrated in tropical ecosystems. However, climate change is a source of considerable uncertainty. While additional research is needed to understand the impact of natural disturbances and biophysical feedbacks, we project that the potential for additional carbon storage in woody biomass will increase (+17%) by 2050 despite projected decreases (−12%) in the tropics.

  {"id":"walkerRoleForestConversion2020","abstract":"Maintaining the abundance of carbon stored aboveground in Amazon forests is central to any comprehensive climate stabilization strategy. Growing evidence points to indigenous peoples and local communities (IPLCs) as buffers against large-scale carbon emissions across a nine-nation network of indigenous territories (ITs) and protected natural areas (PNAs). Previous studies have demonstrated a link between indigenous land management and avoided deforestation, yet few have accounted for forest degradation and natural disturbances—processes that occur without forest clearing but are increasingly important drivers of biomass loss. Here we provide a comprehensive accounting of aboveground carbon dynamics inside and outside Amazon protected lands. Using published data on changes in aboveground carbon density and forest cover, we track gains and losses in carbon density from forest conversion and degradation/disturbance. We find that ITs and PNAs stored more than one-half (58%; 41,991 MtC) of the region’s carbon in 2016 but were responsible for just 10% (−130 MtC) of the net change (−1,290 MtC). Nevertheless, nearly one-half billion tons of carbon were lost from both ITs and PNAs (−434 MtC and −423 MtC, respectively), with degradation/disturbance accounting for >75% of the losses in 7 countries. With deforestation increasing, and degradation/disturbance a neglected but significant source of region-wide emissions (47%), our results suggest that sustained support for IPLC stewardship of Amazon forests is critical. IPLCs provide a global environmental service that merits increased political protection and financial support, particularly if Amazon Basin countries are to achieve their commitments under the Paris Climate Agreement.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Walker","given":"Wayne S."},{"family":"Gorelik","given":"Seth R."},{"family":"Baccini","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Aragon-Osejo","given":"Jose Luis"},{"family":"Josse","given":"Carmen"},{"family":"Meyer","given":"Chris"},{"family":"Macedo","given":"Marcia N."},{"family":"Augusto","given":"Cicero"},{"family":"Rios","given":"Sandra"},{"family":"Katan","given":"Tuntiak"},{"family":"Souza","given":"Alana Almeida","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Cuellar","given":"Saul"},{"family":"Llanos","given":"Andres"},{"family":"Zager","given":"Irene"},{"family":"Mirabal","given":"Gregorio Díaz"},{"family":"Solvik","given":"Kylen K."},{"family":"Farina","given":"Mary K."},{"family":"Moutinho","given":"Paulo"},{"family":"Schwartzman","given":"Stephan"}],"citation-key":"walkerRoleForestConversion2020","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1913321117","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",2,11]]},"page":"3015-3025","publisher":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","source":"www-pnas-org.proxy3.library.mcgill.ca (Atypon)","title":"The role of forest conversion, degradation, and disturbance in the carbon dynamics of Amazon indigenous territories and protected areas","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1913321117","volume":"117"},

Estimates of this absorption vary greatly, in large part due to the effect of different land-use histories on the estimates available in the literature. We relate land-use history to aboveground biomass accumulation of secondary vegetation in plots on land that had been used for agriculture (unmechanized manioc and maize) and for pasture in small rural properties in the Tarumã-Mirim settlement near Manaus in central Amazonia, Brazil. We evaluated inﬂuence of (a) age of the second growth vegetation, (b) time of use as agriculture or pasture and (c) number of times the area was burned. Biomass data were obtained by destructive sampling of all plants with diameter at breast height >1 cm in 24 parcels of secondary vegetation ranging from 1 to 15 years of age in abandoned pasture (n = 9) and agriculture (n = 15). As compared to secondary vegetation in abandoned agricultural ﬁelds, vegetation in abandoned cattle pasture (the predominant use history for Amazonian secondary vegetation) grows 38% more slowly to age 6 years. Number of burns also negatively affects biomass recovery. Applying the growth rates we measured to the secondary forests reported in Brazil’s Second National Communication to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change suggests that carbon uptake by this vegetation is overestimated by a factor of four in the report.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Wandelli","given":"Elisa Vieira"},{"family":"Fearnside","given":"Philip Martin"}],"citation-key":"wandelliSecondaryVegetationCentral2015","container-title":"Forest Ecology and Management","container-title-short":"Forest Ecology and Management","DOI":"10.1016/j.foreco.2015.03.020","ISSN":"03781127","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",7]]},"language":"en","page":"140-148","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Secondary vegetation in central Amazonia: Land-use history effects on aboveground biomass","title-short":"Secondary vegetation in central Amazonia","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378112715001498","volume":"347"},

  {"id":"wangMachineLearningModelling2022","abstract":"Land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) are of importance in natural resource management, environmental modelling and assessment, and agricultural production management. However, LULCC detection and modelling is a complex, data-driven process in the remote sensing field due to the processing of massive historical and current data, real-time interaction of scenario data, and spatial environmental data. In this paper, we review principles and methods of LULCC modelling, using machine learning and beyond, such as traditional cellular automata (CA). Then, we examine the characteristics, capabilities, limitations, and perspectives of machine learning. Machine learning has not yet been dramatic in modelling LULCC, such as urbanization prediction and crop yield prediction because competition and transition between land cover types are dynamic at a local scale under varying natural drivers and human activities. Upcoming challenges of machine learning in modelling LULCC remain in the detection and prediction of LULC evolutionary processes if considering their applicability and feasibility, such as the spatio-temporal transition mechanisms to describe occurrence, transition, spreading, and spatial patterns of changes, availability of training data of all the change drivers, particularly sequence data, and identification and inclusion of local ecological, hydrological, and social-economic drivers in addressing the spectral feature change. This review points out the need for multidisciplinary research beyond image processing and pattern recognition of machine learning in accelerating and advancing studies of LULCC modelling. Despite this, we believe that machine learning has strong potentials to incorporate new exploratory variables in modelling LULCC through expanding remote sensing big data and advancing transient algorithms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Junye"},{"family":"Bretz","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Dewan","given":"M.

However, the accurate estimation of the carbon sequestration capacity of disturbed forests is still challenging due to large uncertainties in their spatial distribution. Using Google Earth Engine (GEE), we developed a novel approach to map cumulative disturbed forest areas based on the 27-year time-series of Landsat surface reflectance imagery. This approach integrates single date features with temporal characteristics from six time-series trajectories (two Landsat shortwave infrared bands and four vegetation indices) using a random forest machine learning classification algorithm. We demonstrated the feasibility of this method to map disturbed forests in three different forest ecoregions (seasonal, moist and dry forest) in Mato Grosso, Brazil, and found that the overall mapping accuracy was high, ranging from 81.3% for moist forest to 86.1% for seasonal forest. According to our classification, dry forest ecoregion experienced the most severe disturbances with 41% of forests being disturbed by 2010, followed by seasonal forest and moist forest ecoregions. We further separated disturbed forests into degraded old-growth forests and post-deforestation regrowth forests based on an existing post-deforestation land use map (TerraClass) and found that the area of degraded old-growth forests was up to 62% larger than the extent of post-deforestation regrowth forests, with 18% of old-growth forests actually being degraded. Application of this new classification approach to other tropical areas will provide a better constraint on the spatial extent of disturbed forest areas in Tropics and ultimately towards a better understanding of their importance in the global carbon cycle.","author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Yunxia"},{"family":"Ziv","given":"Guy"},{"family":"Adami","given":"Marcos"},{"family":"Mitchard","given":"Edward"},{"family":"Batterman","given":"Sarah A."},{"family":"Buermann","given":"Wolfgang"},{"family":"Schwantes Marimon","given":"Beatriz"},{"family":"Marimon Junior","given":"Ben Hur"},{"family":"Matias Reis","given":"Simone"},{"family":"Rodrigues","given":"Domingos"},{"family":"Galbraith","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"wangMappingTropicalDisturbed2019","container-title":"Remote Sens.

To determine whether diversification of plantations would enhance aboveground carbon storage, we systematically reviewed over 11,360 publications, and acquired data from a global network of tree diversity experiments. We compiled a maximum dataset of 79 monoculture to mixed comparisons from 21 sites with all variables needed for a meta-analysis. We assessed aboveground carbon stocks in mixed-species planted forests vs. (a) the average of monocultures, (b) the best monoculture, and (c) commercial species monocultures, and examined potential mechanisms driving differences in carbon stocks between mixtures and monocultures. On average, we found that aboveground carbon stocks in mixed planted forests were 70% higher than the average monoculture, 77% higher than commercial monocultures, and 25% higher than the best performing monocultures, although the latter was not statistically significant. Overyielding was highest in four-species mixtures (richness range 2–6 species), but otherwise none of the potential mechanisms we examined (nitrogen-fixer present vs. absent; native vs. non-native/mixed origin; tree diversity experiment vs. forestry plantation) consistently explained variation in the diversity effects. Our results, predominantly from young stands, thus suggest that diversification could be a very promising solution for increasing the carbon sequestration of planted forests and represent a call to action for more data to increase confidence in these results and elucidate methods to overcome any operational challenges and costs associated with diversification.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Warner","given":"Emily"},{"family":"Cook-Patton","given":"Susan C."},{"family":"Lewis","given":"Owen T."},{"family":"Brown","given":"Nick"},{"family":"Koricheva","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Eisenhauer","given":"Nico"},{"family":"Ferlian","given":"Olga"},{"family":"Gravel","given":"Dominique"},{"family":"Hall","given":"Jefferson S."},{"family":"Jactel","given":"Hervé"},{"family":"Mayoral","given":"Carolina"},{"family":"Meredieu","given":"Céline"},{"family":"Messier","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Paquette","given":"Alain"},{"family":"Parker","given":"William C."},{"family":"Potvin","given":"Catherine"},{"family":"Reich","given":"Peter B."},{"family":"Hector","given":"Andy"}],"citation-key":"warnerYoungMixedPlanted2023","container-title":"Frontiers in Forests and Global Change","ISSN":"2624-893X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"source":"Frontiers","title":"Young mixed planted forests store more carbon than monocultures—a meta-analysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/ffgc.2023.1226514","volume":"6"},

In the last decade ecologists have struggled with two seemingly opposing theories: niche-based theory that explains diversity with species’ differences and the neutral theory of biodiversity that claims that much of the diversity we observe can be explained without explicitly invoking species’ differences. Although ecologists are increasingly attempting to reconcile these two theories, there is still much resistance against the neutral theory of biodiversity. Here we argue that the dispute between the two theories is a classic example of the dichotomy between philosophical perspectives, realism and instrumentalism. Realism is associated with specific, small-scale and detailed explanations, whereas instrumentalism is linked to general, large-scale, but less precise accounts.

Yet, little effort has been made to adjust space-time risk estimation by integrating disease case counts with vector surveillance data, which may result in inaccurate risk projection when several vector species are present, and when little is known about their likely role in local transmission. Here, we integrate 13 years of dengue case surveillance and associated Aedes occurrence data across 462 localities in 63 districts to estimate the risk of infection in the Republic of Panama. Our exploratory space-time modelling approach detected the presence of five clusters, which varied by duration, relative risk, and spatial extent after incorporating vector species as covariates. The Ae. aegypti model contained the highest number of districts with more dengue cases than would be expected given baseline population levels, followed by the model accounting for both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus. This implies that arbovirus case surveillance coupled with entomological surveillance can affect cluster detection and risk estimation, potentially improving efforts to understand outbreak dynamics at national scales.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Whiteman","given":"Ari"},{"family":"Desjardins","given":"Michael R."},{"family":"Eskildsen","given":"Gilberto A."},{"family":"Loaiza","given":"Jose R."}],"citation-key":"whitemanDetectingSpacetimeClusters2019","container-title":"PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases","container-title-short":"PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pntd.0007266","ISSN":"1935-2735","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",9,23]]},"language":"en","page":"e0007266","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Detecting space-time clusters of dengue fever in Panama after adjusting for vector surveillance data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0007266","volume":"13"},

Here, we explore structural uncertainties associated with biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) and quantify their effects on C cycle projections. We find that alternative plausible structures to represent BNF result in nearly equivalent terrestrial C fluxes and pools through the twentieth century, but the strength of the terrestrial C sink varies by nearly a third (50 Pg C) by the end of the twenty-first century under a business-as-usual climate change scenario representative concentration pathway 8.5.

  {"id":"wielandSeedRainAdvance2011","abstract":"Succession in the Brazilian Amazon depends on prior land-use history. Abandoned clearcuts become dominated by Cecropia trees and exhibit species replacements characteristic of natural succession in forest lightgaps. In contrast, abandoned pastures are dominated by Vismia trees that inhibit natural succession for a decade or more. Here we explore how advance regeneration and limited seed dispersal may contribute to the arrested succession in Vismia-dominated stands. Vegetation surveys showed that every Vismia stem in 3–8 year old Vismia stands originated as a re-sprout. In Cecropia stands, all tree species, including Vismia, originated mostly from seeds, after deforestation and abandonment. The 100% re-sprouts of Vismia in the abandoned pastures confirms that Vismia dominance results from re-sprouting following pasture fires. Seed rain in both Vismia and Cecropia dominated stands was limited almost exclusively to second growth species already reproducing in those stands, suggesting that the bats and birds foraging there were not bringing mature forest seeds into the second growth, but simply feeding and depositing local second growth species. As dispersal was similar in both stand types, dispersal differences cannot account for the ongoing dominance of Vismia relative to the ongoing successional transitions in Cecropia stands. Overall, advance regeneration in the form of Vismia re-sprouts is much more likely to be the driver of Vismia dominated succession than differential dispersal of mature forest seeds. In order to avoid extensive forest conversion into unproductive Vismia wastelands in the Amazon Basin, forestry permits for harvesting timber should include restrictions on subsequent anthropogenic degradation, such as conversion to pasture and prescribed burning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Wieland","given":"Lindsay M."},{"family":"Mesquita","given":"Rita C.

Accelerating stress levels, increasing frequencies of extreme events and strengthening intersystem connections suggest that conventional modelling approaches based on incremental changes in a single stress may provide poor estimates of the impact of climate and human activities on ecosystems. We conduct experiments on four models that simulate abrupt changes in the Chilika lagoon fishery, the Easter Island community, forest dieback and lake water quality—representing ecosystems with a range of anthropogenic interactions. Collapses occur sooner under increasing levels of primary stress but additional stresses and/or the inclusion of noise in all four models bring the collapses substantially closer to today by ~38–81%.

Imaging spectroscopy is a tool with potential to help address this challenge. Here, we demonstrate a spectral approach to assess biodiversity effects in young forests that provides insight into its underlying drivers. Using airborne imaging of a tree-diversity experiment, spectral differences among stands enabled us to quantify net biodiversity effects on stem biomass and canopy nitrogen. By subsequently partitioning these effects, we reveal how distinct processes contribute to diversity-induced differences in stand-level spectra, chemistry and biomass. Across stands, biomass overyielding was best explained by species with greater leaf nitrogen dominating upper canopies in mixtures, rather than intraspecific shifts in canopy structure or chemistry. Remote imaging spectroscopy may help to detect the form and drivers of biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships across space and time, advancing the capacity to monitor and manage Earth's ecosystems.","author":[{"family":"Williams","given":"Laura J."},{"family":"Cavender-Bares","given":"Jeannine"},{"family":"Townsend","given":"Philip A."},{"family":"Couture","given":"John J."},{"family":"Wang","given":"Zhihui"},{"family":"Stefanski","given":"Artur"},{"family":"Messier","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Reich","given":"Peter B."}],"citation-key":"williamsRemoteSpectralDetection2021","container-title":"Nature Ecology & Evolution","container-title-short":"Nat Ecol Evol","DOI":"10.1038/s41559-020-01329-4","ISSN":"2397-334X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1]]},"language":"eng","page":"46-54","PMID":"33139920","source":"PubMed","title":"Remote spectral detection of biodiversity effects on forest biomass","type":"article-journal","volume":"5"},

Many development goals are likely underpinned by the delivery of one or more ecosystem services. Understanding how these services could support multiple development targets will be essential for planning synergistic and cost-effective interventions. Here we present the results of an expert survey on the contributions of 16 ecosystem services to achieving SDG targets linked to environment and human well-being, and review the capacity of modelling tools to evaluate SDG-relevant ecosystem services interactions. Survey respondents judged that individual ecosystem services could make important contributions to achieving 41 targets across 12 SDGs. The provision of food and water, habitat & biodiversity maintenance, and carbon storage & sequestration were perceived to each make contributions to >14 SDG targets, suggesting cross-target interactions are likely, and may present opportunities for synergistic outcomes across multiple SDGs. Existing modelling tools are well-aligned to support SDG-relevant ecosystem service planning. Together, this work identifies entry points and tools to further analyze the role of ecosystem services to support the SDGs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Wood","given":"Sylvia L.

We also update a key result and present the first species-level analyses of tree growth rates for a 15-yr factorial nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) experiment conducted in central Panama. The update concerns community-level tree growth rates, which responded significantly to the addition of N and K together after 10 yr of fertilization but not after 15 yr. Our experimental soils are infertile for the region, and species whose regional distributions are strongly associated with low soil P availability dominate the local tree flora. Under these circumstances, we expect muted responses to fertilization, and we predicted species associated with low-P soils would respond most slowly. The data did not support this prediction, species-level tree growth responses to P addition were unrelated to species-level soil P associations. The meta-analysis demonstrated that nutrient limitation is widespread in lowland tropical forests and evaluated two directional hypotheses concerning plant responses to N addition and to P addition. The meta-analysis supported the hypothesis that tree (or biomass) growth rate responses to fertilization are weaker in old growth forests and stronger in secondary forests, where rapid biomass accumulation provides a nutrient sink. The meta-analysis found no support for the long-standing hypothesis that plant responses are stronger for P addition and weaker for N addition. We do not advocate discarding the latter hypothesis. There are only 14 fertilization experiments from lowland, species-rich, tropical forests, 13 of the 14 experiments added nutrients for five or fewer years, and responses vary widely among experiments. Potential fertilization responses should be muted when the species present are well adapted to nutrient-poor soils, as is the case in our experiment, and when pest pressure increases with fertilization, as it does in our experiment. The statistical power and especially the duration of fertilization experiments conducted in old growth, tropical forests might be insufficient to detect the slow, modest growth responses that are to be expected.","author":[{"family":"Wright","given":"S Joseph"},{"family":"Turner","given":"Benjamin L"},{"family":"Yavitt","given":"Joseph B"},{"family":"Harms","given":"Kyle E"},{"family":"Kaspari","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Tanner","given":"Edmund V J"},{"family":"Bujan","given":"Jelena"},{"family":"Griffin","given":"Eric A"},{"family":"Mayor","given":"Jordan R"},{"family":"Pasquini","given":"Sarah C"},{"family":"Sheldrake","given":"Merlin"},{"family":"Garcia","given":"Milton N"}],"citation-key":"wrightPlantResponsesFertilization2018","container-title":"Ecology","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Plant responses to fertilization experiments in lowland, species‐rich, tropical forests","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://esajournals-onlinelibrary-wiley-com.proxy3.library.mcgill.ca/doi/full/10.1002/ecy.2193?casa_token=Ruk2sow41doAAAAA%3ALqH9zajMZAKlrAZOn3Mdsm5mu45STi3-bZUti1_KLHd3fQGpVpFJ7p8qsuC_TR4TTveqi0AT9z03LC8","volume":"99"},

Assuming higher logging rates closer to cultivated zones and spatial diffusion of fire, our spatiotemporal mathematical model reproduces these patterns. Given a gradient of climatic and edaphic factors, rather than bistability there is a predictable spatial boundary, a Maxwell point, that separates regions where forest and savanna states are naturally selected. While bimodality can hence be explained by anthropogenic edge effects and natural spatial heterogeneity, a narrow range of bimodality remaining in the human-unaffected data indicates that there is still bistability, although on smaller scales than claimed previously.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Wuyts","given":"Bert"},{"family":"Champneys","given":"Alan R."},{"family":"House","given":"Joanna I."}],"citation-key":"wuytsAmazonianForestsavannaBistability2017","container-title":"Nature Communications","container-title-short":"Nat Commun","DOI":"10.1038/ncomms15519","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",5,30]]},"language":"en","license":"2017 The Author(s)","number":"1","page":"15519","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Amazonian forest-savanna bistability and human impact","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15519","volume":"8"},

By synthesizing terrestrial and aquatic studies globally (2594 experimental tests from 610 articles), we reveal substantial herbivore control of vegetation under restoration. Herbivores at restoration sites reduced vegetation abundance more strongly (by 89%, on average) than those at relatively undegraded sites and suppressed, rather than fostered, plant diversity. These effects were particularly pronounced in regions with higher temperatures and lower precipitation. Excluding targeted herbivores temporarily or introducing their predators improved restoration by magnitudes similar to or greater than those achieved by managing plant competition or facilitation.

  {"id":"xuSoilPhosphorusCycling2024","abstract":"Deforestation of tropical rainforests is a major land use change that alters terrestrial biogeochemical cycling at local to global scales. Deforestation and subsequent reforestation are likely to impact soil phosphorus (P) cycling, which in P-limited ecosystems such as the Amazon basin has implications for long-term productivity. We used a 100-year replicated observational chronosequence of primary forest conversion to pasture, as well as a 13-year-old secondary forest, to test land use change and duration effects on soil P dynamics in the Amazon basin. By combining sequential extraction and P K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy with soil phosphatase activity assays, we assessed pools and process rates of P cycling in surface soils (0–10 cm depth). Deforestation caused increases in total P (135–398 mg kg−1), total organic P (Po) (19–168 mg kg−1), and total inorganic P (Pi) (30–113 mg kg−1) fractions in surface soils with pasture age, with concomitant increases in Pi fractions corroborated by sequential fractionation and XANES spectroscopy. Soil non-labile Po (10–148 mg kg−1) increased disproportionately compared to labile Po (from 4–5 to 7–13 mg kg−1). Soil phosphomonoesterase and phosphodiesterase binding affinity (Km) decreased while the specificity constant (Ka) increased by 83%–159% in 39–100y pastures. Soil P pools and process rates reverted to magnitudes similar to primary forests within 13 years of pasture abandonment. However, the relatively short but representative pre-abandonment pasture duration of our secondary forest may not have entailed significant deforestation effects on soil P cycling, highlighting the need to consider both pasture duration and reforestation age in evaluations of Amazon land use legacies.

  {"id":"yangDetectionAttributionExtreme2023","abstract":"Negative extreme anomalies in vegetation growth (NEGs) usually indicate severely impaired ecosystem services. These NEGs can result from diverse natural and anthropogenic causes, especially climate extremes (CEs). However, the relationship between NEGs and many types of CEs remains largely unknown at regional and global scales. Here, with satellite-derived vegetation index data and supporting tree-ring chronologies, we identify periods of NEGs from 1981 to 2015 across the global land surface. We find 70% of these NEGs are attributable to five types of CEs and their combinations, with compound CEs generally more detrimental than individual ones. More importantly, we find that dominant CEs for NEGs vary by biome and region. Specifically, cold and/or wet extremes dominate NEGs in temperate mountains and high latitudes, whereas soil drought and related compound extremes are primarily responsible for NEGs in wet tropical, arid and semi-arid regions. Key characteristics (e.g., the frequency, intensity and duration of CEs, and the vulnerability of vegetation) that determine the dominance of CEs are also region- and biome-dependent. For example, in the wet tropics, dominant individual CEs have both higher intensity and longer duration than non-dominant ones. However, in the dry tropics and some temperate regions, a longer CE duration is more important than higher intensity. Our work provides the first global accounting of the attribution of NEGs to diverse climatic extremes. Our analysis has important implications for developing climate-specific disaster prevention and mitigation plans among different regions of the globe in a changing climate.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Yang","given":"Hui"},{"family":"Munson","given":"Seth M."},{"family":"Huntingford","given":"Chris"},{"family":"Carvalhais","given":"Nuno"},{"family":"Knapp","given":"Alan K."},{"family":"Li","given":"Xiangyi"},{"family":"Peñuelas","given":"Josep"},{"family":"Zscheischler","given":"Jakob"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Anping"}],"citation-key":"yangDetectionAttributionExtreme2023","container-title":"Global Change Biology","DOI":"10.1111/gcb.16595","ISSN":"1365-2486","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2023 The Authors.

These data often require preprocessing prior to analysis to account for sensor, solar, atmospheric, and topographic effects. However, ecologists using these data are faced with a literature containing inconsistent terminology, outdated methods, and a vast number of approaches with contradictory recommendations. These issues can, at best, make determining the correct preprocessing workflow a difficult and time-­consuming task and, at worst, lead to erroneous ­results. We address these problems by providing a concise overview of the Landsat missions and sensors and by clarifying frequently conflated terms and methods. Preprocessing steps commonly applied to Landsat data are differentiated and explained, including georeferencing and co-­registration, conversion to radiance, solar correction, atmospheric correction, topographic correction, and relative correction. We then synthesize this information by presenting workflows and a decision tree for determining the appropriate level of imagery preprocessing given an ecological research question, while emphasizing the need to tailor each workflow to the study site and question at hand. We recommend a parsimonious approach to Landsat preprocessing that avoids unnecessary steps and recommend approaches and data products that are well tested, easily available, and sufficiently documented. Our focus is specific to ecological applications of Landsat data, yet many of the concepts and recommendations discussed are also appropriate for other disciplines and remote sensing platforms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Young","given":"Nicholas E."},{"family":"Anderson","given":"Ryan S."},{"family":"Chignell","given":"Stephen M."},{"family":"Vorster","given":"Anthony G."},{"family":"Lawrence","given":"Rick"},{"family":"Evangelista","given":"Paul H."}],"citation-key":"youngSurvivalGuideLandsat2017","container-title":"Ecology","container-title-short":"Ecology","DOI":"10.1002/ecy.1730","ISSN":"0012-9658, 1939-9170","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",4]]},"language":"en","page":"920-932","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A survival guide to Landsat preprocessing","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecy.1730","volume":"98"},

Subsequent forest regrowth partially offsets carbon emissions from deforestation, but is often repeatedly cleared and burned. In the first quantitative, basin-wide assessment of the effect of repeated clearing and burning on forest regrowth, our analysis of data from 93 stands at nine locations across the region indicates that stands with a history of five or more fires suffer on average a greater than 50% reduction in carbon accumulation. In the absence of management interventions, Amazonian landscapes dominated by this pronounced legacy of fire are apt to accumulate very little carbon and will remain highly susceptible to recurrent burning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Zarin","given":"Daniel J."},{"family":"Davidson","given":"Eric A."},{"family":"Brondizio","given":"Eduardo"},{"family":"Vieira","given":"Ima CG"},{"family":"Sá","given":"Tatiana"},{"family":"Feldpausch","given":"Ted"},{"family":"Schuur","given":"Edward AG"},{"family":"Mesquita","given":"Rita"},{"family":"Moran","given":"Emilio"},{"family":"Delamonica","given":"Patricia"},{"family":"Ducey","given":"Mark J."},{"family":"Hurtt","given":"George C."},{"family":"Salimon","given":"Cleber"},{"family":"Denich","given":"Manfred"}],"citation-key":"zarinLegacyFireSlows2005","container-title":"Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment","DOI":"10.1890/1540-9295(2005)003[0365:LOFSCA]2.0.CO;2","ISSN":"1540-9309","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005"]]},"language":"en","license":"© The Ecological Society of America","page":"365-369","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Legacy of fire slows carbon accumulation in Amazonian forest regrowth","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/1540-9295%282005%29003%5B0365%3ALOFSCA%5D2.0.CO%3B2","volume":"3"},

The consequences of this vegetation–atmosphere feedback for the stability of the Amazon forest are still unclear. Here we show that the risk of self-amplified Amazon forest loss increases nonlinearly with dry-season intensification. We apply a novel complex-network approach, in which Amazon forest patches are linked by observation-based atmospheric water fluxes. Our results suggest that the risk of self-amplified forest loss is reduced with increasing heterogeneity in the response of forest patches to reduced rainfall. Under dry-season Amazonian rainfall reductions, comparable to Last Glacial Maximum conditions, additional forest loss due to self-amplified effects occurs in 10–13% of the Amazon basin. Although our findings do not indicate that the projected rainfall changes for the end of the twenty-first century will lead to complete Amazon dieback, they suggest that frequent extreme drought events have the potential to destabilize large parts of the Amazon forest.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Zemp","given":"Delphine Clara"},{"family":"Schleussner","given":"Carl-Friedrich"},{"family":"Barbosa","given":"Henrique M.

The dynamical behavior of stochastic delay on the regime shifts between oligotrophic and eutrophic states is analyzed using numerical simulations. Time delays in loss and recycling processes are considered. It is shown from time series and probability distribution that noises and delays can induce regime shifts between two stable states. Theoretical analyses are used to support our numerical simulations. By using the mean first passage time (MFPT) technique, we also discuss the escape time problem between two stable states in time-delayed ecosystems.

  {"id":"zermeno-hernandezEcologicalDisturbanceRegimes2015","abstract":"Methods: Interviews were conducted with local farmers to quantify disturbance components (size, duration and severity) associated with agricultural land uses. The scaled values of these disturbance components were added in a simple ecological disturbance index (EDI). In each one of nine recently abandoned ﬁelds representing a wide range of EDI values, two 10-m2 plots, one close to and one far from nearby forest remnants, were established. On each plot, all woody plants of 10–100 m in height were counted, identiﬁed and measured in four 1m2 subplots, at the time of ﬁeld abandonment and 2 yr later. In addition, at each plot, 18 site condition (microclimate and soil) attributes were quantiﬁed at the time of abandonment. Plant density, biomass, species richness and species diversity were used as regeneration variables, and EDI and site condition attributes as independent ones.\nResults: Two years after abandonment, most regeneration variables declined exponentially with EDI. Biomass was not explained by EDI but changed positively with light availability. EDI was strongly correlated to vapour pressure deﬁcit, which also predicted regeneration potential (except biomass).\nConclusions: EDI is a cheap and easy tool for quantifying the ecological disturbance produced by a wide range of agricultural land uses. The index predicted several regeneration variables as well as or better than direct measurements of the site condition at the time of abandonment. EDI can be used to identify biodiversity-friendly agricultural land uses in human-modiﬁed landscapes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Zermeño-Hernández","given":"Isela"},{"family":"Méndez-Toribio","given":"Moisés"},{"family":"Siebe","given":"Christina"},{"family":"Benítez-Malvido","given":"Julieta"},{"family":"Martínez-Ramos","given":"Miguel"}],"citation-key":"zermeno-hernandezEcologicalDisturbanceRegimes2015","container-title":"Applied Vegetation Science","container-title-short":"Appl Veg Sci","DOI":"10.1111/avsc.12161","editor":[{"family":"Hölzel","given":"Norbert"}],"ISSN":"14022001","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",7]]},"language":"en","page":"443-455","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Ecological disturbance regimes caused by agricultural land uses and their effects on tropical forest regeneration","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/avsc.12161","volume":"18"},

This has been perceived as a problem for ecosystem stability, pest control, local biodiversity and long-term nutrient availability. In our study, we followed the effects of increasing tree diversity (1, 3 and 6 native species) on aboveground nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) pools in a young experimental biodiversity plantation (central Panama) over two subsequent years. Our results show a positive but not consistent net effect of biodiversity on the N and P pools, mainly explained by the complementarity effect. N and P use efficiencies strongly varied among the investigated tree species and the species richness gradient. Anacardium excelsum and Luehea seemannii were associated with higher N and P use efficiencies while Hura crepitans and Tabebuia rosea were less efficient in aboveground biomass production per unit N or P. Tree species tended to have lower P use efficiencies in the intermediate diversity level compared to monocultures and six-species mixtures. Although the environmental conditions explained a large part of the variation in the N and P pools (58%) in our experiment, we argue that incorporating tree mixtures in the management can bring additional benefits and improve tree growth and nutrient uptake as compared to the monocultures.","author":[{"family":"Zeugin","given":"F."},{"family":"Potvin","given":"C."},{"family":"Jansa","given":"J."},{"family":"Scherer-Lorenzen","given":"M."}],"citation-key":"zeuginTreeDiversityImportant2010","container-title":"For.

  {"id":"zimbresMappingStockSpatial2021","abstract":"The Brazilian Cerrado biome consists of a highly heterogeneous tropical savanna, and is one of the world’s biodiversity hotspots. High rates of deforestation, however, place it as the second-largest source of carbon emissions in Brazil. Due to its heterogeneity, biomass and carbon stocks in the Cerrado vegetation are highly variable, and mapping and monitoring these stocks are not a trivial effort. To address this challenge, we built an aboveground woody biomass (AGWB) model for the Cerrado biome using 30-m resolution optical satellite im­ agery (Landsat-5 and Landsat-8), 25-m resolution SAR imagery (ALOS and ALOS-2), and a set of plot-based and LiDAR-derived AGWB estimates (n = 1858) from a wide network of researchers in Brazil. We implemented both a Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and a Random Forest (RF) algorithm to model AGWB over the native vegetation in the year 2019 (as classified by MapBiomas) in the Cerrado. The RF algorithms resulted in a slightly better result (R2 = 53%; rel. RMSE = 57%) than the CART model (R2 = 45%; rel. RMSE = 63%), but our map shows an underestimation of very high AGWB (negative bias over 200 t ha− 1) and a slight overestimation of low AGWB (positive bias), especially in the RF model (bias of 1.19 t ha− 1 against 0.86 t ha− 1 for the CART model).

  {"id":"zuletaDamageLivingTrees2023","abstract":"Accurate estimates of forest biomass stocks and fluxes are needed to quantify global carbon budgets and assess the response of forests to climate change. However, most forest inventories consider tree mortality as the only aboveground biomass (AGB) loss without accounting for losses via damage to living trees: branchfall, trunk breakage, wood decay. Here we use ~151,000 annual records of tree survival and structural completeness to compare AGB loss via damage to living trees to total AGB loss (mortality + damage) in seven tropical forests widely distributed across environmental conditions. We find that 42% (3.62 Mg ha-1 yr-1; 95% CI 2.36–5.25) of total AGB loss (8.72 Mg ha-1 yr-1; CI 5.57–12.86) is due to damage to living trees. Total AGB loss was highly variable among forests, but these differences were mainly caused by site variability in damage-related AGB losses rather than by mortality-related AGB losses. We show that conventional forest inventories overestimate stand-level AGB stocks by 4% (1-17% range across forests) because assume structurally complete trees, underestimate total AGB loss by 29% (6-57% range across forests) due to overlooked damage-related AGB losses, and overestimate AGB loss via mortality by 22% (7-80% range across forests) because of the assumption that trees are undamaged before dying. Our results indicate that forest carbon fluxes are higher than previously thought. Damage on living trees is an underappreciated component of the forest carbon cycle that is likely to become even more important as the frequency and severity of forest disturbances increase.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Zuleta","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Arellano","given":"Gabriel"},{"family":"McMahon","given":"Sean M."},{"family":"Aguilar","given":"Salomón"},{"family":"Bunyavejchewin","given":"Sarayudh"},{"family":"Castaño","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Chang‐Yang","given":"Chia‐Hao"},{"family":"Duque","given":"Alvaro"},{"family":"Mitre","given":"David"},{"family":"Nasardin","given":"Musalmah"},{"family":"Pérez","given":"Rolando"},{"family":"Sun","given":"I‐Fang"},{"family":"Yao","given":"Tze Leong"},{"family":"Valencia","given":"Renato"},{"family":"Krishna Moorthy","given":"Sruthi M."},{"family":"Verbeeck","given":"Hans"},{"family":"Davies","given":"Stuart J."}],"citation-key":"zuletaDamageLivingTrees2023","container-title":"Global Change Biology","container-title-short":"Global Change Biology","DOI":"10.1111/gcb.16687","ISSN":"1354-1013, 1365-2486","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",6]]},"language":"en","page":"3409-3420","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Damage to living trees contributes to almost half of the biomass losses in tropical forests","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.16687","volume":"29"},
  {"id":"zuquimIntroducingMapSoil2023","abstract":"Soil maps are crucial for habitat and species distribution modeling under present and future conditions, thereby providing relevant background information for conservation planning. In Amazonia, soil conditions are highly heterogeneous, which has important implications for the distribution and dynamics of the area's exceptional biodiversity. Unfortunately, available soil maps for this region suffer from inaccuracies and lack of ecologically relevant variables. Here, we develop a map of the sum of exchangeable base cation concentration (SB) in the surface soil by applying machine learning to a comprehensive set of over 10,000 field data points of SB values directly measured from soil samples or inferred using indicator plant species occurrences. As predictors, we used rasters of soil type probabilities, elevation, biomass and reflectance values from Landsat satellite images. Random Forest (RF) models were trained and tested using two different cross-validation strategies. We also assessed in which areas the map was more reliable using the area of applicability approach and compared the results with two other soil layers. The best predictors of SB variation were Landsat bands 7, 4 and 3, elevation, and probability of Histosols. The regional patterns observed across Amazonia were consistent with current geological understanding; lower SB values tended to occur in central Amazonian soils and higher values in western Amazonian soils, with considerable variation within each region. The model was found applicable over most of the Amazonian biome, especially in non-inundated (terra-firme) forest, but not over coastal areas, floodplains of major rivers and wetlands, which were poorly represented in the training data. Our new SB map over performed previous SB map and represent an accurate and ecologically meaningful variable. It is available as a digital GIS layer and can be used in habitat mapping and in modeling the current or future distributions of biological communities and species. This will advance general understanding of Amazonian biogeography and help in conservation planning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Zuquim","given":"G."},{"family":"Van doninck","given":"J."},{"family":"Chaves","given":"P.
