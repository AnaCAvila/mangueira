Making a story sticky (SUCCES)

Keep it simple. Find the simple story in complex data - what is explaining a seemingly complex outcome?

Novelty and unexpected. Enhance the discovery of your work. What is new about it? What piece of the old question can bring it forward?

Concrete - give examples, go into details, make the concept visible (opposite of abstraction)

Credibility - make something become believable and a proposal can be supported if it is grounded on concrete ideas and explained simply, in a credible manner.

Emotional - enhance curiosity. Ask a novel question, bring something unexpected. Excite the reviewers.

Stories. Pack your knowledge into a coherent unit.
