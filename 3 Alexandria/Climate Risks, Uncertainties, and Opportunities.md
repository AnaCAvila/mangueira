The solution, according to carbon models, tends to be reaching zero by 2050.

The estimated cost is approximately 200$ per ton of CO2 - but the number could be much higher.
- Nature 2022, rennert, comprehensive evdence implies a higher social cost of CO2

Tipping points - collapse of Amazon, ice sheets - increase social cost in 27-43%, potentially even more as the PDF has a large right-side tail.

16 tons of CO2 per american per year
8 per european
...
final cost of all emossions is about 8-10% of global GDP.

Swedes tax themselves 130$ per tCO2.

in EU you pay about 100E$ per tCO2

There is no one silver bullet policy solution for the entire world.

Given the costs of congestion, per car that enters NYC should cost about 150$ - not even CO2 considered, just the cost of traffic!
- the thing is, at his high level of cost, you may as well reimagine Manhattan such that it's car-free. NYC right now is implementing a congestion tax of about 20$, much less than the real cost.

So, there must be alternative costs - figure out how to internalize massive costs.

Tail risks are a real issue, and climate policy is insurance - it will reduce future costs and disaster.

How much does each strategy cost per ton of CO2 removal?
Left hand side pays for itself - right hand side starts costing money.
Removing slash and burn agriculture and pastureland conversion, as well as restoring degraded land and forest, give a lot of return per cost!

Solar and Wind pays for itself

The thing is, things that pay for themselves cost a lot upfront:

The cost of actually reducing emissions to zero is not much higher than we are already spending in less efficient strategies
Ana's thought: the thing is does this actually lead to more sequestration? What do those strategies really look like?

A lot of the ongoing strategies are inefficient. Inflation Reduction in the US makes solar panels cheaper everywhere - economic output not only in the US, but in other global north countries, can increase. - paper where this is cited is called "clean growth"

Solar is the cheapest electric energy in history???

Relative price changes matter, not absolute.
