Economics and ecology both are concerned with the house

## emergence and pattern formation

Sustainability has to focus on macroscopic features (eco services) while recognizing that control rests at lower levels (like you can study thermodynamics, but bear in mind how particles boil because they move differently)

- Relative statistics of different species of trees

these models can explain global patterns, but not individual species abundances (MAPSS)

Ecotypes, not species, can be predicted as a larger scale (from the follows and dutkiewicz)

he's woking on trait-based models right now!

### pattern formation

Turing proposed a model to explain how patterns emerge - how you can get complex life from something so simple as an egg. In absence of diffusion, there's an equilibrium - with diffusion theres inhibitors and activators.

Uniform distribution of cells, then symmetry is broken but patterns are 

in turing models there is only breaking of symmetry to give rise to higher patterns

macroscopic rules are lagrangian

activators could be phytoplankton and inhibitors be zooplankton

individuals be interacting with each other based on F = ma, fluid motion (think fish schools or bird flocks) statistical mechanics of the ensemble

game theory - 


commons solution (hardin) - mutual coercion, mutually agreed upon

uninformed individuals promote democratic consensus in animal groups - couzin science

common pool resource is something like air, where my ability to use something doesn't reduce another's ability to use it

collective action emerges from local action

multiple scales: collective decision impose mutual coercion, mutually

Given the challenges of climate change, what questions would you consider most crucial for the scientific community to focus on to mitigate the crisis? I'm thinking of education strategies for example (given the effects of stubborn misinformed individuals, how can we change their minds?), maybe ecosystem management (how should forests and fisheries be better managed), and maybe an improvement on renewable energy sources?

the most difficult thing is getting individuals to cooperate. distrust and the willingness to vilify someone like fauci for given scientifically informed advice.

social media is a big deal about polarization. people watch the stations that reinforce their views, finding ways to get believable sources out there - CDC, NIH- 10 years ago nobody would question their legitimacy! ==increasing public trust in science.== don't know how to do that, but that involves the educational system.

build on the potential for building cooperation in local communities - some local communities want to sustain coal, but we need ==cooperative agreements.== find ways for people to recognize the advantages in collective intelligence. we need to get beyond the idea of politics as a zero sum game.
his research: under what conditions do animals realize that being together is best

==local agreements== so people realize that what's best for all is best for them.

we've lost that on public health for example.


It is an ongoing research question how different political parties can affect stability. Also, reelections and time scales can be an issue since solutions need to be longer term.

new question: decrease in quality of life leads to polarizaiton. economist interview Richard Wolff
	political parties reduce the dimensionality of the system.

Fragile Dominion - in a system with good states and bad states, like climate change, it's a problem since by the time a signal is detected and change can happen there's already drastic effects that are very hard to avoid.

on an interview, economist Richard Wolff attributed the extreme polarization to decrease in quality of life and economic crisis - people are hungry and desperate, and they go for the "Hitlers" of their era.
How does stress factor in your research of polarization?

There's feedbacks. ==Inequality increase has definitely been explored.== These things coevolve.
- city of afabasca in alberta, collapsed with the oil industry. When industries collapse, as well as fisheries, and migration patterns due to climate change. People become more desperate and will vote for more populist candidates.
- people can be retrained to focus their skills on viable alternatives.

The population is aging. This can make it difficult for people to continue working late in life as tech increases and AI evolves, as older people have a harder time keeping up with new tech. AI will increase disparity across ages. Immigration can be a solution, but some people don't want to move and there's increasing anti-immigration.

critical biology - Complex adaptive systems


I have a question on another topic. In terms of the Alan Turing morphogenesis model, could breaks in symmetry of diffusive stabilities and pattern emergence lead to significant events of evolution? For example, bacterial cells are individuals that share mobile elements between their neighbours (i.e. must be close by), which contribute to whole populations becoming increasingly antimicrobial resistant or even poly-antimicrobial resistant. Do you have any comments on this phenomena?

Antibiotic resistance is a huge threat to us. Why do we overuse antibiotics and underuse vaccines?
- people don't care about the long term when they're sick, they just want to get better.
- hospitals are the best source of antibiotic resistant bacteria.

we need interdisciplinary cooperation. yes, we need more modellers, or more modelling skills among empirical people. Brazil will be the easiest to accomplish that.

Political decisions in latin america are still very much made by politicians that don't trust or don't understand science. There's some people working on modelling the Amazon, but quantitative people are often few and more isolated from the public, at least in Brazil.
Do you find that we need more modellers, and more integrated modellers? Do you find that we are worse at communicating science than other scientists?
