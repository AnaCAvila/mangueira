Science writing must be engaging yet dispassionate, like journalism. The main issue happens when you let your biases and desires permeate the writing. We don't impose the story into the data; instead, we must take the story from it.

Provide knowledge/understanding from the data/information; don't forget the big picture. Listen for the story the data is trying to tell. Take time to explore it, and do not publish too soon so you may publish better later.

People think that to sound scholarly you need to use difficult jargon.

To be a really good scientist, you HAVE to be multi-talented, or at least basic competence in multiple areas - writing, talking, math, reading, organization, biology, people skills.

Take a step back after verbalizing/writing and then have a different new view. Putting together TALKS about something may help putting ideas together. Reading your writing out loud also helps.

You don't need to be a talented writer since writing is also a science - using a top sentence to summarize things, 3 sentences, 1 sentence to end.

Always good if a paper does suggest caveats and potential different interpretations of the data. Always be wary of very black and white statements in such a relative field as biology.

Reviewing more papers with a more critical mindset is a good idea.
