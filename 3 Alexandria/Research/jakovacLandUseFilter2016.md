#### Notes:
 
> <span style="color: #90EE90">In this study we aim to answer the following questions: (1) does previous land use act as a filter for species composition in secondary forests; and (2) what are the relative roles of management practices, soil properties and landscape composition in determining species composition?</span> 

  

> <span style="color: #FFC0CB">We found that previous land-use intensity determined species composition.</span>

 

 > <span style="color: #F9E076">With increasing land-use intensity, management practices of cut-andburn and associated reduction in soil quality filtered out seed-dependent species and favoured strong sprouters and species that can cope with low nutrient availability.</span>

  

> <span style="color: #FFC0CB">Dispersal limitation has a limited effect on determining the composition of the dominant species.</span>

 

 > <span style="color: #F9E076">Our analysis showed that the effect of land use on species composition was mediated by a hierarchy of factors, where number of previous swidden-fallow cycles emerged as the primary determinant, followed by clay content and P availability.</span>

 

 > <span style="color: #F9E076">Alternative successional pathways in the Amazon have been reported to continue to diverge during the first three decades of succession</span>
