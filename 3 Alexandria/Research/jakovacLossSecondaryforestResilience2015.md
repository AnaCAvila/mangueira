#### Notes:
 
> <span style="color: #90EE90">Here, we evaluate how the intensification of a swidden cultivation system affects secondary-forest resilience in the Amazon.</span> 

  
> <span style="color: #90EE90">we analysed the relative role of management intensity, soil properties and landscape configuration in determining the resilience of early secondary forests</span> 

 

 > <span style="color: #F9E076">We assessed resilience as the recovery level of forest structure and species diversity achieved by SFs 5 years after abandonment.</span>

  

> <span style="color: #FFC0CB">The recovery of forest structure was determined by management intensity, while the recovery of species diversity was driven by landscape configuration.</span>

  

> <span style="color: #FFC0CB">Secondary-forest resilience decreased with land-use intensification, mainly mediated by the effect of management intensity upon regeneration strategies.</span>

 

 > <span style="color: #F9E076">To evaluate the effect of management intensity, soil properties and landscape configuration on SF structure and diversity parameters, we used mixed-effects models.</span>

 

 > <span style="color: #F9E076">We performed model selection by stepwise removal of the least significant fixed factors, applying the maximum likelihood method of parameter estimation until we got to the final model with the lowest Akaike information criterion (AIC) value</span>

 

 > <span style="color: #F9E076">For five out of seven forest structure variables, management intensity was the only significant factor (Table 3): percentage of resprouting individuals, liana infestation and density of ramets increased with management intensity, while stand basal area and canopy height decreased</span>
