> <span style="color: #90EE90">Here we infer the timing and origin of the living biota in all major Neotropical regions by performing a crosstaxonomic biogeographic analysis based on 4,450 species from six major clades across the tree of life (angiosperms, birds, ferns, frogs, mammals, and squamates), and integrate >1.3 million species occurrences with large-scale phylogenies.</span>

> <span style="color: #FFC0CB">iotic interchange has taken place for >60 million years and generally i</span>

 

 > <span style="color: #F9E076">Based on the Theory of Island Biogeography (29), there should be a positive relationship between the number of dispersal events and the area of a region, and a negative relationship with geographic isolation.</span>

 

 > <span style="color: #F9E076">In general, the more combined time lineages spend in a region (expressed as total branch lengths in a phylogeny), the more opportunities they should have to diversify and emigrate</span>

 

 > <span style="color: #F9E076">We therefore take advantage of recently published, well-sampled molecular phylogenies, which hold a large but unrealized potential in revealing the evolution of tropical biotas</span>

 

 > <span style="color: #F9E076">ongoing invasions are likely also related to the higher human density seen in species-rich environments (34). In addition, the high number of immigrants will, by themselves, also lead to an increase in the total branch length of a region. We also note that branch length sums were strongly correlated to the total number of occurrences in a region, meaning we cannot exclude an undetected effect of sampling biases beyond our measure of phylogenetic sampling.</span>

  

> <span style="color: #FFC0CB">even very dissimilar regions, in terms of environmental variables and constituent biota, do not evolve in isolation, but are highly biologically interconnected over evolutionary timescales.</span>
