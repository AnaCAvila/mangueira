- We need global standardized forest biomass reference measurements:

- At least 1ha sample plots
- Airborne LiDAR coverage
- Complementary terrestrial LiDAR

- Data is to be collected synchronously with Earth Observation
- Broad range of environmental conditions
- Sites are to be selected in areas where they are likely to be maintained in a long run by experts.

This study looks at 200 sites worldwide and sees how much they represent three dimensions of biomass:

Environmental

Temperature and prec (and their seasonality)

Solar radiation

TerraClimate dataset - na alternative to WorldClim?

Edaphic data (SoilGrids 2.0)

Physical (coarse fragment content and sand fraction)

Chemical (pH and CAC)

Geographical

How distant from each other are the plots?

Structural

Canopy height and tree cover fraction are both estimated from space.
Ducanson et al 2019 - These tools need to be validated with ground-truthed data.
