#### Notes:

 > <span style="color: #F9E076">When applying to larger spatial scales, a benchmark classification of phenologically different forest types is required and the method needs to be applied separately to the different forest classes that have different phenological patterns, making the AVOCADO algorithm increasingly laborious with increasing spatial scales</span>

 

 > <span style="color: #F9E076">AVOCADO is sensitive to gradual changes and thereby able to accuratelydetect forest degradation and forest regrowth;</span>

 Remote sensing of environment 

AVOCADO ALGORITHM 

What does it add to previous algorithms? 

- captures gradual change (unlike rgrowth, for example) 

- would be possible to incorporate logging for example 

- is less effective on dry tropical forest because NDMI of crops is quite similar to NDMI of the forest itself... so be careful with that. Regrowth was flagged accidentally. 

Some sociological factor studies only show the probability of permanence of forests depending on different sociological factors; forests may be allowed to regrow for 5-20 years before being cleared up again. This could just be a predictor for fallow period, but that’s gathered from remote sensing anyways, so it’s kind of useless for my study. 

The algorithm is calibrated with nearby mature forests.
