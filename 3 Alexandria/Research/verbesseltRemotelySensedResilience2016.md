 > <span style="color: #F9E076">Here we use worldwide time series of satellite images to show that temporal autocorrelation, an indicator of slow recovery rates5, rises steeply as mean annual precipitation declines to levels known to be critical for tropical forests.</span>

 
Temporal autocorrelation -> observations taken closely in time are correlated – slower change increases it. 

They looked at temporal autocorrelation in satellite data from tropical forests to see if there is evidence of slowing down of growth – but seeing change in slowness over time would need longer time series information, which is lacking.

They looked at spatial patterns of slowness.

NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) shows plant activity, biomass and cover to tell forest health. Note – cloud cover may be an issue and needs to be accounted for. VOD – Vegetation optical depth, shows water content in biomass from RADAR data. They used regression to look at temporal autocorrelation at different moisture indexes. It is possible to infer slowness in forest growth from space, and temporal autocorrelation is probably a good indicator of resilience.
