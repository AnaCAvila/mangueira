Pure LiDAR obtained from transect flights of the forest. As the data hasn't been ground-truthed, I don't know if I can use it for anything, as it may be hard to transform the pure LiDAR into biomass.

One [study used it to map canopy gaps](https://besjournals-onlinelibrary-wiley-com.proxy3.library.mcgill.ca/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2745.14003), as well as [[REGENERA]]
