#### Notes:
 
> <span style="color: #90EE90">In this study, we evaluate the consequences of agricultural intensification for management practices and swidden productivity in one of the main cassava producing areas of the Brazilian Amazon.</span> 

  

> <span style="color: #FFC0CB">Broadening market opportunities and improving technical assistance to farmers could raise the diversification of production and sources of income and guarantee higher resilience to the system.</span>
