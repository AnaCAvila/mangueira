#### Notes:
<p>  <span style="color: #F9E076">For example, a recent study has shown that the net carbon uptake of Amazonian old-growth forests has declined by a third per decade from 1990 to 2010 (1, 2)</span>  </p> 
[[How do mature forests keep on sequestering carbon after they've reached peak community]]

<p>  <span style="color: #F9E076">For instance, in 2010 about 25% of formerly deforested areas in Para, Brazil, were occupied by secondgrowth forests.</span>  </p> <p>  <span style="color: #F9E076">eir net carbon sequestration rate is up to 20 times higher (4.6 to 5.8 Mg carbon ha–1 year–1) (3) than old-growth forests (1).</span>  </p> <p>  <span style="color: #F9E076">Additionally, about one-quarter of the forests in the Amazon basin are managed for timber production.</span>  </p> <p>  <span style="color: #F9E076">Net carbon sequestration rates after timber extraction are high, and the application of reduced-impact logging techniques further increases carbon sequestration rates</span>  </p> [[040 Social Context of Latin America MOC]]
