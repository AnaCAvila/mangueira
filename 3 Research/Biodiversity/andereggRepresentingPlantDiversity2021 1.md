Representing plant diversity in land models: An evolutionary approach to make ‘Functional Types’ more functional

Anderegg et al, 2022

What was done?

Plant Functional Types are a reductionist way of describing plants.

ESMs (earth system models) should include ecological dynamics (biome distributions).

Ecological and evolutionary solution.

- niche conservatism - more similar evolutionary means likely to be more similar ecologically

Benchmarking = evaluate or check (something) by comparison with a standard (golden standard)

Introduction

PFT parameters examples

- canopy roughness
- PS capacity
- nutrient uptake efficiency
- root depth

can be quite general (trees, shrubs/evergreen, deciduous/temperate, tropical).

and DO NOT CAPTURE MOST VARIATION!

Diversity increases resilience.

new ‘Lineage Functional Types’ (LFTs) representing three dominant global grass clades can capture considerable variation in physiology, morphology, and response to disturbance that the two classic grass PFTs— which differentiate only C3 vs C4 photosynthetic mechanisms – cannot capture.

equifinality (many different parameter sets yield similar predictions, making more complicated models more difficult to parameterize to the point where added complexity decreases model predictive ability

“trait based modelling’ either completely ignores PFT and only looks at variations in the way the plants interact with their environment, or PFT aren’t pre-determined, but generated based on a modelled competitive search through parameter space. but the issues are:

- traits that are model parameters aren’t necessarily the ones that explain ecological differences
- useful as simple models, unable to represent high-dimensional problems, with stabilizing mechanisms not included in the models, such as co-existence and maintenance of diversity
- trait-climate relationships are hard to understand when looking at all land plants:

- economic strategies are different
- weak relationships between trait and environmental variables
- not consistent across taxonomy and biomes

those are good at a smaller scale, but not for ESM.

Implications for benchmarking model biogeography

Letting Evolution be your guide

Niche conservatism = cousins tend to retain their traits and niches (at broad scales)

Many plant traits that are related to model parameters show phylogenetic signal

trait canalization = how evolvable it is

trait lability =

How do we get this info from “sparse observations"?

What are those nuances and complications?

Some traits are very plastic : leaf nitrogen per unit leaf area (Narea) and allometric traits such as root to shoot biomass ratio (R:S) or leaf area to sapwood area ratio (AL:AS) vary enormously within species and over time

Infer process as well as parametrization

In some instances, lineage-based functional types may result in lumping together deciduous and evergreen species in a way that classic PFTs do not.

Leaf longevity depends on lineage rather than classic PFT?

Where cold stress is absent (e.g., in the tropics), leaf lifespan is more variable within clades.

niche vs. neutral’ debate

most plant communities are comprised of a few abundant and many rare species

My conclusions

I had never questioned PFT and it was interesting to think about it.

Foliar nitrogen can be well measured by remote sensing, and it is phylogenetically conserved! very cool!

NEON is a cool project
