>[!summary] Summary
> 


Planted forests in Panama 2.5-28 years old showed 70% more carbon in mixed plantations. 

No significant effect was found solely from the presence of nitrogen fixers present or absent – that may be from the combination effect from it with other effects. 

The relationship between diversity and function is expected to increase, non-saturating over time. 

Positive effect of biodiv on biomass was present in both experimental as well as forestry plantations. 

Age was used as a random effect.
