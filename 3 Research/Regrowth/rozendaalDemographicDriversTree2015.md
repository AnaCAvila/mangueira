### Notes
  
![[Pasted image 20230910153734.png]]

Rate of biomass change decreased with stand age. 

Secondary growth specialist species dominated in 10-41 years, and generealists. 

Tree growth drives biomass gain early in succession, and growth and mortality drive it more later in succession. 

Background literature/chronosequence studies shows that rate of growth is higher during early stages of succession, and slows down to asymptote. There may be a thinning stage in between early increase in basal area of early pioneers and the transition of the late-successional species. 

Previous studies show a reduction in the rate of growth of secondary forest plots with time (Rozendaal et al 2015, ). This study did not show an initial delay; initial stands were 10 years old, and fallow periods can often happen below this time period. The study assumes that early increases in biomass may be linear. The article also showed an increase in biomass in old growth forests, which may be attributed to CO2 fertilization or recovery from past disturbance. The shape of the growth curve of secondary forests comes from tradeoffs between tree mortality and growth of a few species, with mortality playing a bigger role later in succession. It would be a fair assumption to say that presence of such species, and proximity to old growth forests where they occur, would encourage growth.
