Secondary growth rates vary in different regions of the amazon due to environmental heterogeneity and post-succession disturbance 

the relationship between secondary forest regrowth and environmental and disturbance drivers has never been explored spatially explicitly using global remote sensing products.

Secondary forests uptake more carbon than primary. Carbon sequestration in the west is higher than in the east (phosphorus may matter here?). Carbon stocks could be higher with less fire and deforestation. Carbon stocks are lower in regions with water deficit. Deforestation of secondary forests means 70% of amazon forest loss. 

However, the relationship between secondary forest regrowth and environmental and disturbance drivers has never been explored spatially explicitly using global remote sensing products. 

Spatial variation in secondary forest regrowth – this article shows the differences in growth rates among the amazon basin due to natural factors (precipitation, soil moisture, shortwave radiation). 

- Expect higher regrowth in the north.
- Importance of fire and deforestation varies with the region - fires disturb wet forests less.

Species in secondary growth forests have smaller seeds and lower wood density. 

There is fire and deforestation that happen after regrowth has already begun, and that changes regrowth rates the most. Proximity to other forests could also make a difference (seed bank). Would be interesting to look at spatial heterogeneity in the process. 

DATA

- Santoro
- Mapbiomas
- Modelled through Chapman Richards

Divided the Amazon in three climatic zones rather than seeing climate as a continuous variable.

- Radiation
- Precipitation
- Maximum cumulative water deficit
- Soil cation concentration as a proxy for fertility
- Burned area (MODIS, Terra - Didan 2015)
- Number of deforestations
