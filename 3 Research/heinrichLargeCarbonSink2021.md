#### Notes:
 
> <span style="color: #90EE90">spatial regrowth patterns due to environmental and disturbance drivers. Here we quantify the influence of such drivers on the rate and spatial patterns of regrowth in the Brazilian Amazon using satellite data.</span> 

 

 > <span style="color: #F9E076">Identifying the proximity of secondary forests to disturbed versus undisturbed forests could potentially be another driving variable impacting the regrowth rates we have calculated in this study.</span>

 

 > <span style="color: #F9E076">The drivers used in this study to assess regrowth potential can be developed further to include other important variables that influence regeneration and regrowth. This includes variables such as the proximity to other forest landscapes, both young and old and disturbed and undisturbed51,54 as well as the type of previous land-use practices (livestock, agriculture and forestry) and the period of active land use before abandonment</span>

 

 > <span style="color: #F9E076">Only areas of secondary forest greater than 9000 m2 were considered for further analysis, an area approximately equal to 1 pixel of the ESA-CCI product.</span>

 

 > <span style="color: #F9E076">Mean annual downward shortwave radiation</span>

 

 > <span style="color: #F9E076">Maximum Cumulative Water Deficit (MCWD)</span>

 

 > <span style="color: #F9E076">The drivers were then grouped according to numerical limits, such as the 25, 50 and 75th percentiles. We then modelled the AGC for the age of secondary forest under these groupings using the commonly used Chapman-Richard model for regrowth67:</span>

 

 > <span style="color: #F9E076">The “cforest” random-forest model provides more accurate importance estimates compared to more traditional random-forest models such as “randomForest” when the dataset includes both</span>
