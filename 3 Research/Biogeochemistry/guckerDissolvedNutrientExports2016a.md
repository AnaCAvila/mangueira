### Notes

Dissolved nutrient exports from natural and human-impacted neotropical catchments

Gucker, 2016

Compare N and P runoff to water in untouched and disturbed land

Agriculture changes runoff of N and P to water. May affect downstream ecosystems. Raises the question of whether to consider hydrology in models

Organic forms dominated in south/southeast brazil, but this varies a lot across the neotropics. Land use increased runoff of both organic and inorganic, but did not change org N dominance. P data was more difficult but land use may also increase P exports.

Inorg > org runoff tendencies across the neotropics are variable, and there is more org dominance in human affected ecosystems.

inorg N export and concentrations appear to decrease with deforestation and transformation of pristine lands into cattle pasture, but to increase with subsequent crop production.

A single case study on massive sugar cane produc- tion in south-eastern Brazil indicates that intensification ofagri- culture in the Neotropics may eventually lead to massive increases in and dominance of DIN exports (Table

might be interesting to distinguish inorg N from org N in dissolved matter in water

Consider variation across landscapes (different ratios were found across neotropics - different agro practices, maybe?)

Our results suggest the possibility of a broad gradient of N richness in the Neotropics across which catchment exports vary from DON to DIN dominance. The central and south-east Brazilian N-limited catchments with highly dominant DON exports were one endpoint in this gra- dient and N-rich Costa Rican and Trinidadian catchments with large and proportionally dominant DIN exports the other.

land-use change in the Neotropics might affect the timing and seasonality of dissolved nutrient exports, with potentially important implications for downstream systems.
