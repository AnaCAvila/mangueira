## Notes

 <span style="color: yellow">Hutchinson (1961): “Why do so many species co-exist?</span>  </p> <p>
 <span style="color: yellow">Many species do, in fact, co-exist in most ecosystems. (2) It is counter-intuitive, and thus fascinating:</span>  </p> <p>
 <span style="color: yellow">) The set of mechanistic explanations to resolve this question (e.g., Chesson 2000) is large, and crosses boundaries of discipline and scale</span>  </p> <p>
 <span style="color: yellow">n Peter Vitousek and Bob Howarth’s “Nitrogen limitation on land and in the sea: How can it occur?”</span>  </p> <p>
 <span style="color: yellow">... nitrogen fixers should have a competitive advantage wherever nitrogen is limiting, and ... their activity in turn should reverse limitation.</span>  </p> <p>
 <span style="color: yellow">However, a recent meta-analysis (Harpole et al. 2011) found that only 28% of 641 studies revealed co-limitation by nitrogen and phosphorus. Why are 72% of ecosystems not co-limited? They could be co-limited by other resources, of course, but even the lack of colimitation by nitrogen and phosphorus is cause for investigation.</span>  </p> <p>
