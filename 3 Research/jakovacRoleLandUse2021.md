Compared models, studies on hierarchical basis of succession and community assembly rules. 

Sites available for succession are defined by socioeconomical and biophysical rules. 

Esse artigo é bem mais amplo do que eu preciso pra minha pesquisa; dá uma visão geral de tudo que afeta o estabelecimento de uma espécie, e leva em consideração biomassa total. 

A framework/socioeconomic drivers describing successional pathways 

Land use history has effects on: 

- species availability to succession 
- species establishment and performance 

Approaches: 

similar-age comparison (varying land histories, but same age, multiple plots) 

chronosequence 

longitudinal (same plot remeasured over time) 

hierarchical model of succession 

(1) availability of open sites, (2) differential availability of species, and (3) differential performance of species at the site. 





How land use history defines successional pathways? 

Discussion 

Defends proxies for land use history itself. 
### Land use type can be correlated with land use intensity

Satellite could give us proxies where land use information is not available. 

Write down the correlations that have already been studied. 

Study the differences between

- Norden 2015, Arroyo 2017 
- basal area and canopy height are reduced after each cropping cycle

What should I incorporate into a future model? 

Socioeconomics. "The permanence of regrowth is higher in landscapes with lower accessibility, population density and demand for agricultural production." 

Land use type can be correlated with land-use intensity (meaning severity of impact rather than intensity of the input of the disturbance) 

Most factors used were: 

Frequency of burning events and cropping cycles 

Length of fallow period 

Duration of continuous land use 

Other factors could be: 

Weeding frequency 

Machinery use 

Soil amendment 

Crop type 

What is currently known about the effects of previous land use in the accumulation of biomass? 

It's not that simple to determine just how different proxies describe land use. What are the correlations between them? 

Descriptors of land use history 

Mainly describes the different ways to define and study the problem. In my case, it’s American forests in general, using multiple land use descriptors (LU type, frequency, duration, intensity, extent), response variable plant community, approach modelling/similar-age comparison? 

Most studies on secondary succession only reported the type of previous land use (61%) but did not assess other descriptors - usually a proxy for land use intensity or severity of the impact on succession. 

Land use type: shifting cultivation, other agriculture, pasture. 

Few studies have incorporated type of crop. 

Defends using proxies and correlations among descriptors to make it easier to incorporate previous land use. 

Correlations: 

The longer the land use, the more frequent are fires. 

Time since deforestation started ~ land use intensity and duration 

Duration of land use ~ frequency of disturbance and distance to other forest fragments 

- Initial conditions have a big impact on the community decades into succession. 

Assessing previous land-use history, therefore, is challenging and ideally requires a combination of field data and remote-sensing approaches (e.g. Dias et al., 2016; Dutrieux et al., 2016) 

Vegetation patterns defined by previous land-use history 

What is known about how forests regrow after land use? 

- pastures and mechanized agriculture generate lower recovery rates than shifting agriculture and low-input agriculture. 
- agroforestry can have different effects. Biomass recovery was higher after coffee/cacao plantation abandonment than palm or pastures, because there were still trees remaining. However, their shade inhibited native species growth.
