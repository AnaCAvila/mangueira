at-a-glance: "Global plot estimates of carbon uptake by forests concludes high efficiency, specially young growth"

--- 

>[!summary] Summary
> With plot data, they studied the size and distribution of carbon sink around the world. Concluded forests can make a big difference, specially young ones

>[!note] Cited?
> Secondary forests sequester carbon faster than mature

#### Notes:
 <p>  <span style="color: #F9E076">Our total forest sink estimate is equivalent in magnitude to the terrestrial sink deduced from fossil fuel emissions and land-use change sources minus ocean and atmospheric sinks.</span>  </p> 
[[What is the current contribution of forest regrowth to carbon sequestration]]
 <p>  <span style="color: #F9E076">Except for the Amazon drought, the recent excess of biomass C gain (growth) over loss (death) in tropical intact forests appears to result from progressively enhanced productivity</span>  </p> <p>  <span style="color: #F9E076">we lack data about changes in soil C stocks for tropical intact forests, so the C sink for tropical intact forests may be underestimated.</span>  </p>
 
 Tropical and subtropical forests account for approximately 70% of the world's gross forest C sink
 <p>  <span style="color: #F9E076">Tropical regrowth forests (557 Mha) represent ~30% of the total tropical forest area.</span>  </p> This is smaller than [[poorterBiomassResilienceNeotropical2016]] estimate of 50% regrowing forests, just 5 years later.
 <p>  <span style="color: #F9E076">Our results indicate that tropical regrowth forests were stronger C sinks than the intact forests due to rapid biomass accumulation under succession, but these estimates are poorly constrained because of sparse data</span>  </p>
