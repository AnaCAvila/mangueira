at-a-glance: "Agriculture and land use should be considered for climate change mitigation"

--- 

>[!summary] Summary
> There is not enough emphasis on land use as climate mitigation because emissions are hard to quantify. Still, those emissions are significant and should be studied and incorporated into mitigation strategies

>[!note] Cited
>About one-third of the current anthropogenic CO2 emissions are removed by terrestrial ecosystems, mainly forests

#### Notes:
<p>  <span style="color: #FFC0CB">Assuming full implementation of (I)NDCs, we show that land use, and forests in particular, emerge as a key component of the Paris Agreement: turning globally from a net anthropogenic source during 1990–2010 (1.3   1.1 GtCO2e yr 1) to a net sink of carbon by 2030 (up to 1.1   0.5 GtCO2e yr 1), and providing a quarter of emission reductions planned by countries.</span>  </p> 


<p>  <span style="color: #F9E076">Land use, including agriculture and forests, accounts for about 10% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as CO2, and nearly a quarter including CH4 and N2O</span>  </p> 
Would be interesting to look into the [[N2O as a greenhouse gas]] in agriculture
<p>  <span style="color: #90EE90">this analysis quantifies the expected GHG mitigation role of the land-use sector in the (I)NDCs to the year 2030</span>  </p> <p>  <span style="color: #90EE90">It focuses on CO2 emissions and removals and non-CO2 emissions from Land Use, LandUse Change and Forestry (LULUCF, primarily deforestation and forest management), encompassing most of the land-use sector identified in (I)NDCs</span>  </p> <p>  <span style="color: #F9E076">in the past UNFCCC negotiations the LULUCF sector has often been treated separately and considered as a secondary mitigation option, largely due to its complexity and limited trust in data.</span>  </p> This connects with some of what I had seen in the [[Carbon exports]] papers - so much of the land use emissions are ignored!
