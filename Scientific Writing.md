### My Guidelines on Writing
- One point per paragraph, one paragraph per point.
- *Write as you would speak* - maybe speak out the text first, and then organize it as it's easier for the words to flow. ChatGPT can help transcribe spoken text to something acceptable.
- When stuck, *writing by hand can help*.
- Read/write a little every day.
- Only use reference to help determine amount of detail needed.
- *Add subheadings* - you can always take them away later.
- Interesting to write a title as personifying the object of study, when speaking to the public.
- Short titles get more attention.

**Olivia Milloway's tips**
- Think of communicating with a 13 year old - that is when most people stop taking science classes.
	- also useful for interdisciplinary communication!
- Write personal journal entries - forces you out of 3rd person objective voice. Could work in a blog format.
- Build a professional website. It can have a news/stories page.
	- Species feature/naturalist diary - talk about special tree species/groups. Reminds me of "um pé de que?"
		- plantas alimenticias não típicas
		- non timber forest products
