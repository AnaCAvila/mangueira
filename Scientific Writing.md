[[Writing Science]]

### Tools
- Overleaf (journals have templates for it)
- Markdown

### My Guidelines on Writing
- One point per paragraph, one paragraph per point.
- *Write as you would speak* - maybe speak out the text first, and then organize it as it's easier for the words to flow. ChatGPT can help transcribe spoken text to something acceptable.
- When stuck, *writing by hand can help*.
- Read/write a little every day.
- Only use reference to help determine amount of detail needed.
- *Add subheadings* - you can always take them away later.
- Interesting to write a title as personifying the object of study, when speaking to the public.
- Short titles get more attention.
