### My Guidelines on Writing
- One point per paragraph, one paragraph per point.
- *Write as you would speak* - maybe speak out the text first, and then organize it as it's easier for the words to flow. ChatGPT can help transcribe spoken text to something acceptable.
- When stuck, *writing by hand can help*.
- Read/write a little every day.
- Only use reference to help determine amount of detail needed.
- *Add subheadings* - you can always take them away later.
- Interesting to write a title as personifying the object of study, when speaking to the public.
- Short titles get more attention.

### Pixar method
Once upon a time, there was a big forest that had been cut down and burned to give space for agriculture.

Every day, farms were abandoned so new baby forests could grow on the empty land, but it was hard to predict how quickly they would grow back.

Then one day, we decided to learn how the ways in which the land was burned and cropped would change the way the forest grows.

Because of that we could consider how the quality of the soil can affect regrowing forests

And because of that we can make better predictions of how these forests will grow

Until finally we can better plan where reforestation efforts should be implemented to bring the forest back faster
