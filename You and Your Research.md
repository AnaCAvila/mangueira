>[!summary] In summary, I claim that some of the reasons why so many people who have greatness within their grasp don't succeed are: they don't work on important problems, they don't become emotionally involved, they don't try and change what is difficult to some other situation which is easily done but is still important, and they keep giving themselves alibis why they don't. They keep saying that it is a matter of luck. I've told you how easy it is; furthermore I've told you how to reform. Therefore, go forth and become great scientists!

This reminds me a bit of the Outliers book claim that once you reach the same status, luck plays much less of a role. Which makes sense - I had to be insanely lucky to get to McGill, but once I get here, there's not much stopping me from doing well.
	Still, of course, there's multiple factors like the lack of background, inherent feeling of isolation and fear, financial instability. All that is a result of luck, as well as extroversion and meeting the right people. But it's much less of a factor than a lot of other things that are very much within my control right now.

## Luck

Genius is 99% perspiration and 1% inspiration


I definitely feel the idea that with effort, I can achieve a lot. I've been incredibly lucky, so I can put in the effort.

## Courage

> Einstein, somewhere around 12 or 14, asked himself the question, ``What would a light wave look like if I went with the velocity of light to look at it?'' Now he knew that electromagnetic theory says you cannot have a stationary local maximum. But if he moved along with the velocity of light, he would see a local maximum. He could see a contradiction at the age of 12, 14, or somewhere around there, that everything was not right and that the velocity of light had something peculiar. Is it luck that he finally created special relativity? Early on, he had laid down some of the pieces by thinking of the fragments. Now that's the necessary but not sufficient condition.

Hamming also mentions how success brings confidence and courage, and how those two are essential. I definitely feel that, as once I started feeling confident that I could work well, I did start improving a lot.

Confidence can also be an issue - with the people who win Nobel Prizes, two things happen: they either start getting very full of themselves and only tackle the "big problems", missing out on the important tiny problems that can lead to breakthroughs, but also they get sucked into committees and other commitments and leave research aside.

> I spent a good deal more of my time for some years trying to work a bit harder and I found, in fact, I could get more work done. I don't like to say it in front of my wife, but I did sort of neglect her sometimes; I needed to study. You have to neglect things if you intend to get what you want done. There's no question about this.

Durante a adolescência, eu sacrifiquei e deu muito certo. Agora, adiante, ainda dá pra fazer a mesma coisa. Já tá tudo certo, agora é seguir a produção. Coragem não me falta, já cheguei até aqui, agora é seguir.

> *Question*: What about personal stress? Does that seem to make a difference?
> *Hamming*: Yes, it does. If you don't get emotionally involved, it doesn't. I had incipient ulcers most of the years that I was at Bell Labs. I have since gone off to the Naval Postgraduate School and laid back somewhat, and now my health is much better. But if you want to be a great scientist you're going to have to put up with stress. You can lead a nice life; you can be a nice guy or you can be a great scientist. But nice guys end last, is what Leo Durocher said. If you want to lead a nice happy life with a lot of recreation and everything else, you'll lead a nice life.

Maybe the feeling that I had before, that you need to make big sacrifices for science, that the great scientist is ultimately a recluse - maybe I was right. Going full circle?
	Of course, not the case for everyone. There's people like Fiona, doing awesome research but also having vacations and a life. But Fiona is a biogeochemist and botanist, and I kinda aim to do everything and be in a battlefront in Latin America. Maybe that adds a whole layer of complexity to things that although won't lead to the Nobel, will suck up the rest of my life just the same. Maybe I don't really care about it - maybe teenage Ana had a point in staying at home to study.


### Good working conditions can stifle creativity
Doesn't that apply a lot to Brazilian scientists??
Having to innovate from not having the ideal conditions can force you to think harder and come up with better ideas.

## Commitment to science

It's important to have an **emotional commitment** and to keep thinking of the problem, so your *subconscious* keeps working on it even as you sleep. That is very true and I definitely feel it. Also, it's important to know *ambiguity* - having enough confidence in the idea, but enough doubt to look and see the breakthroughs. Also, it's good to know what are the *important questions* in my field. - I actually don't know these well and should keep a log going - really spend some time pondering the great thoughts.

**Good colleagues to bounce ideas are the best way to brainstorm** - learning from people who know what they are talking about is often better than studying alone.

It's important to set aside the ego and **sell the ideas** properly. Prioritize science over your pride and your presentation - if you have to dress a certain way to be taken seriously, do it. Also, it's important to *conform to management* just enough, but to know how to *convince your boss* when you are right.

**Transform your fault into an asset.** I have a big tendency to want to read too much and *explore too many rabbit holes*. I have definitely benefitted from that, but I still must keep that under control so that my work flows properly.
