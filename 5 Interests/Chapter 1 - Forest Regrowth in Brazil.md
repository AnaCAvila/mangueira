## Arguing for importance
- Amazonia is becoming a carbon source.
- Brazil, Panama and Costa Rica are areas of importance in forest conservation in Latin America
- The Amazon contains 50% of the forested area in the world
- Costa Rica has 6% of the world's biodiversity
- Tropical forests presently cover about 1.84 billion hectares or about 12 percent of Earth's land surface (3.6% of Earth's surface).
- Brazil has the largest extent of rainforest cover, including nearly two-thirds of the Amazon.
- An estimated 50 percent of terrestrial biodiversity is found in rainforests
- Deforestation and degradation of tropical forests account for roughly 10 percent of global greenhouse emissions from human activities
- amazon absorbs one fourth of all CO2 absorbed by land on earth (pan et al 2011)

41 anthropogenic CO2 emissions are removed by terrestrial ecosystems, mainly forests"
