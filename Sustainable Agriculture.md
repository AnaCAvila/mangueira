Cacao agroforestry may be a viable substitute to monocultures in Latin America. Potential research idea - if there is a way to quantify the large-scale ability of the forest to provide fruit and to maintain itself with healthy carbon cycling over a large period, we could quantify potential profits of agroforestry over monocultures.
	Main issue is whether these products would be exportable - who would buy very expensive cacao? - and whether carbon credits can be used in the 3 years that it takes cacao to reach maturity.


[[Alliance Biodiversity International & CIAT]] is a billion-dollar NGO working with Latin American sustainable agriculture.

Also timber may be a good idea? [[bongersPotentialSecondaryForests2015]] says it can be managed in a way to maximize C uptake!
