## Make it so
- [ ] Finish and submit [FRQNT 2024-2025](https://frq.gouv.qc.ca/en/program/frqnt-2024-2025-doctoral-training-scholarships/)
- [ ] Organize code
- [ ] Contacts that went cold: Jonathas/Jude/Javier/Beth
	Write email on LU classification and SAR biomass

- [ ] incorporate error from [[ESA Biomass]].
	- With the size of the error bars, we can weigh their effect on the final AGB estimate.

- [ ] Incorporate data from the rest of the forest - not just a small region
	- Do the same for the forest age
	- Check if there's differences in the relationship across the biome.

- [ ] Investigate all other predictors:
	- soil
	- CWD (check regionality/magnitude)
	- Mature forest cover
	- AET

## Shore leave
- [ ] Quebec forms
- [x] Email Brian about Panama
- [ ] Organize courses
- [ ] Finish bringing data sources/lit from excel to Obsidian
- [ ] Transcribe Andrew/stats notes
- [ ] Set up morning/bed/gym routine
- [ ] Use excalidraw to make photosynthesis/N cycle schemes
- [x] check out [Ilya](https://twitter.com/Artifexx) twitter for good obsidian ideas! ✅ 2023-09-29
- [ ] set up google keep for fleeting notes
- [ ] Look into how to easier maintain [zotero tags](https://pressbooks.library.yorku.ca/masteringzotero/chapter/working-with-tags/)
	- Brainstorm topics with Excalidraw to get meaningful tags
- [ ] Read a few papers
	including [Impact of the 2015–2016 El Niño on the carbon dynamics of South American tropical forests | Nature Climate Change](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01777-3)
	[Prioritizing where to restore Earth’s ecosystems (nature.com)](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02750-2)
