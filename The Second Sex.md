> [!note] Summary

There is no two opposites - masculinity is the default, and femininity is the "other". Gender-neutral clothes are masculine clothes, but female-coded clothes are completely unaccessible to men.
- Still, this is something that occurred over the 20th century in the West - before then, men's clothes were just as unaccessible to women. Also, men's clothes are still unaccessible to women in some cultures, and displays of gender differ a lot between indigenous cultures. 


> I wonder if radfem that reject heterosexuality base off of this book to some degree?
