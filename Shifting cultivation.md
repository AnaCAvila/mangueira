Swidden farming, also know as shifting cultivation or milpa in Latin America, is conventionally defined as “an agricultural system in which temporary clearings are cropped for fewer years than they are allowed to remain fallow” 

Farmers encourage and allow forest regrowth by reducing burning and allowing stumps to maintain fertility in the soil.
