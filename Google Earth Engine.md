- Needed to use earthengine auhenticate --auth_mode=notebook to install. Thanks [SpatialThoughts!](https://courses.spatialthoughts.com/install-gee-python-api.html)
- [community datasets](https://github.com/samapriya/awesome-gee-community-datasets)

Image <- one Scene
- ImageCollection
Feature <- polygons, points, lines
- FeatureCollection
## Javascript
*Why use APIs instead?*
- It is not recommended to run for loops in the GEE interface
- cannot run deep learning
- an API allows to overlay GEE data with my own other datasets
But since a lot of resources come in javascript, it's good  (and very possible) to have some basic understanding of the code. Also, there's the window to visualize things immediately!
