## Javascript
*Why use APIs instead?*
- It is not recommended to run for loops in the GEE interface
- cannot run deep learning
- an API allows to overlay GEE data with my own other datasets
But since a lot of resources come in javascript, it's good  (and very possible) to have some basic understanding of the code. Also, there's the window to visualize things immediately!
