## Ecosystem services
Has worked on estimating them on **monetary** terms, but has started to realize its limits. Both it may be unfeasible, but also not always people will pay attention even as you translate things into dollars.

**Health** outcomes can be a better way to measure ecosystem services, that will get attention without all the uncertainty and ethical questions of financial issues.

> The burden of environment on disease is concentrated on low income countries. - Patanayak and Pfaff 2009

## Planetary Health

One health system - human, soil, environmental, livestock...
The Rockefeller Foundation-Lancet commission meets every year.

Planetary Health, One Helath, Ecosystem services, EcoHealth... ==all the same!==

## Diarrhea and Water Pollution

Decisions/policies cause changes in the environment, which then cause a negative health outcome, which can be avoided with a mediating strategy (bed nets for mosquitos, vaccines), but otherwise will affect human communities.

==Diarrhea is the second biggest killer of children in the world.== Watershed pollution can be caused by policy and lack of sanitation will affect children.

US has a standard survey in developing countries to measure health outcomes, social factors, and sanitation factors. Encompasses 800k children across 49 countries.

Herrera et al 2017 coupled this information to land use and climate as well as human activities.

- *Human activity upstream increases risk, and tree cover upstream reduces risk on rural households.* Urban households are less reliant on upstream water, so they are less susceptible to land use changes upstream.
- *Human activity was found to not be correlated to tree cover*, as it is measured in population or livestock heads.
- *Precipitation was measured in the dry season*, so the data may be different for non-seasonally dry patches.
- The pattern is *consistent across regions.*

## Deforestation, malaria and diet

Estifanos et al under review shows that there is an increase in malaria risk with deforestation in rural households.
Diet diversity is more reliant on the forest in populations closer to the border.

- the signal is general enough to be detected at large scales.

## Mental Health

Park visits affect mood, as measured in social media.
- improved mood
- reduced stress
- improved cognition on tests
- prosociality

UVM Hedonometer is an interesting tool that measures happiness based on twitter data - 10% of all tweets - for 18 years up until 2022.

Every city in the US shows a happiness bump after nature exposure - except for Baltimore.
- no differences noticed across different park types.
- this effect did not relate to a city's wealth or investment in green areas
- nature out of a window changes recovery rates in hospitals
- plants in rooms can make people kinder

## Going forward

### Provide policy context
- show what the alternatives are - how does disease change in the scenario with and without forest growth?
- What is the expected change in the issue that you are tackling with the solution you are proposing?
- Compare to costs - Das and Vincent 2009 showed that preserving mangroces is the most cost effective way to protect coastal people against cyclones

### Focus on who benefits and suffers
- Fires will affect respiratory health of people upwind
- Poor, black neighborhoods have less greenery than wealthy neighborhoods

### Consider the system
- the same policy can change ecosystems in multiple ways, and they can have conflicting effects on health risk

### Represent everyone
- Gallegos-Riofrio 2022 - Nature and Mental Health studies are 90% done in WEIRD countries, overwhelmingly white, and in most studies people didn't report ethnicities.
