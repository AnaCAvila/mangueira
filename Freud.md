> Psychoanalysis still views
psychoneurosis as an illness: it considers as normal an individual who is self-confident, does
not have states of anxiety or depression etc., while for positive disintegration,
psychoneurosis is not an illness but an important condition for development. For Dąbrowski,
people who are not content with themselves, who are anxious about their development and
feel inferior to what they could be and who have inhibitions are of better mental health than
those that psychoanalysis regards as "pictures of health", because they undergo a process
of positive change. https://www.positivedisintegration.com/Dziekanowski2010.pdf

> As it is universally
known, psychoanalysis considers development a result of interaction of two factors: heredity
and environment. The Theory of Positive Disintegration assumes that autonomy is the third
factor. It is of great theoretical-practical consequence. It is the autonomous strength that, to
a degree, allows an individual to develop independently, as they are able to choose which
direction to evolve and to transcend the inherited elements that are inseparably linked to
biological constitution and the environment, in order to become in reality what they are
potentially. Moreover, Dąbrowski claims that Freudian psychoanalysis underrated heredity in
favour of the role of the environment
