>[!summary] Summary
> 


<p>  <span style="color: #F9E076">Here, we used time series of annual MapBiomas land cover data to generate the first estimates of SV extent, age, and net carbon uptake in the Brazilian Amazon between 1985 and 2017</span>  </p> <p>  <span style="color: #F9E076">This approach does not account for regional variation in SV growth rates from climate or soils or local-scale variation based on prior land use or distance from seed sources</span>  </p> 
- Estimated carbon gains and losses by changes in extent of secondary forests
- No carbon info was used. Used [[MAPBIOMAS]] classes.
- This study does not account for variation by prior land use, climate, soil, or seed sources.
