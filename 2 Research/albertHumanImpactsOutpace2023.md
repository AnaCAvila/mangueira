#### Notes:

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">The Amazon is the most species rich subcontinental-scale ecosystem and is home to more than 10% of all named plant and vertebrate species, concentrated into just 0.5% of Earth’s s surface area.</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #90EE90">We found that rates of anthropogenic processes that affect Amazonian ecosystems are up to hundreds to thousands of times faster than other natural climatic and geological phenomena.</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #90EE90">In this Review, we compare rates of anthropogenic and nat atural environmental changes in the Amazon and South America and in the larger Earth system. We focus on deforestation and carbon cycles because of their critical roles on the Amazon and Earth systems.</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #90EE90">Policies to prevent the worst outcomes are known and must be enacted immediately. We now need political will and leadership to act on this information.</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">Extreme droughts and record floods have occurred in nine of the past 15 years, compared with just four extreme droughts and three record floods in the previous century</span>
    

    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">As of 2019, a cumulative total of about 17% of the pre-Columbian Amazon forest had been cleared, and 14% replaced, by human agriculture landscapes — 89% for pasture and 11% for crops</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">n the Amazon, more than in most other regions, forest-rainfall feedback is required to maintain the current forest cover</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">About half of the precipitation over the Amazon is recycled from evapotranspiration,</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">This dependence of the state of the system on its history (hysteresis) is a common feature of many ecological systems at large spatial and temporal scales, in which the observed state of a system cannot be predicted on the basis of current conditions alone.</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">Amazon forest extent and structure is therefore highly sensitive to widespread forest degradation and removal (</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">Agricultural expansion is the leading cause of regional deforestation worldwide and in South America</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">Effective forest-protection policies act by removing the internationa al financing of marketdriven land-conversion projects.</span>
    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">Amazonian forests and soils contain about 180 ± 30 Gt of carbon (GtC); approximately half of this carbon is stocked in the form of vegetation biomass, and the other half remains assoil carbon stocks</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">To better compare the volume of Amazon carbon impact on global climate, we note that Amazonian afforestation in the centuries after the Iberian conquest (around 1500 to 1700) captured about 7.4 GtC (3.5 ppm CO2 equivalent) from the atmosphere, perhaps contributing to the global cooling episode known as the Little Ice Age</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">In an ice-free world, global sea levels would reach ~65 m (~213 feet) above the present level, as high as they were in the supergreenhouse world of the Eocene about 56 million years ago (90). Such melting would raise the global sea level 93 to 162 mm per year averaged over the next few centuries, starting slow (averaging 3.1 mm per year in the past 30 years) and accelerating toward the final collapse of the ice sheets.</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #90EE90">The current state and future fate of the Amazon are inextricably bound to that of the entire Neotropical region, the global biosphere as a whole, and the future of civilization worldwide</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">Policy actions must be implemented to reverse climate change and reduce economic incentives in the international trade system that support export-driven economic development</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">Successful economic development in many parts of the world has historically rested on a robust legal framework that incentivizes prosocial—and disincentivizes antisocial—behaviors and activities (1</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">For example, in a landmark ruling, the Constitutional Court of Ecuador applied the constitutional provision on the “Rights of Nature” to safeguard cloud forests from mining concessions</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">A successful bioeconomy extends beyond extractive and export-based economic activities (such as lumber, mining, soy, and cattle) by prioritizing and monetizing biodiversity and ecosystem services and promoting broad development goals in education, health, sanitation, and employment.</span>
    



    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">Desired outcomes of a new Amazonian bioeconomy optimize carbon sequestration, biodiversity recovery, and human livelihoods</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">Paramount among these needs are high-quality communication and transportation services to improve the commercialization of products, as well as institutional investments and international collaborations that support education, science, and technology institutions located within the Amazon.</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">By contrast, market mechanisms based on international commodity pricing have entirely failed to assess the real economic and social values of Amazonian landscape and ecosystem resources (99, 120). Further, prospects are dim for using market forces in landscape conservation efforts in the near future</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">Such a Grand Energy Transition is already well underway</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">One of the biggest challenges is the high volume of fossil carbon still sequestered within the lithosphere; about 60% of oil and fossil methane gas and 90% of coal must be left in the ground to limit global warming to 1.5°C</span>
