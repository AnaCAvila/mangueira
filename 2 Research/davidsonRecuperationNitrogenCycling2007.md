Early succ forests are N limited, must use deep soil N. Late succ becomes P limited 

Young forests are much more N conservative after agricultural abandonment, but become more P-conservative as they age. There are more N2O soil emissions as the forest ages. 

N accumulates as soils age since it’s mostly coming from the atmosphere. Meanwhile, P is more abundant in young soils, but becomes more bound to minerals as weathering proceeds, such as in heavily weathered tropical soils. Tropical forest litter has higher N:P ratios. 

Forest cleaning means nutrients are lost by burning (nitrogen), erosion (phosphorus). Nitrogen leaches more quickly than P. 

Over time, there is a recuperation of the nitrogen cycling processes that had been lost. 

Once more, argument that there must be use of N at soil depths to maintain the observed rates, it cannot all be fixation. 

Used foliar, litterfall and soil NO3, NH4 as the data
