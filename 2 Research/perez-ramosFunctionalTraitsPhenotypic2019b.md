> <span style="color: #90EE90">we couple field experiments under two contrasting climatic conditions to a plant population model</span> <span style="color: #90EE90">to evaluate how 19 functional traits, covering physiological, morphological and reproductive characteristics, are associated with species’ niche and fitness differences</span> 

> <span style="color: #FFC0CB">traits and their plasticity promote species coexistence across climatic conditions by enhancing stabilizing niche differences and by generating competitive trade-offs between species.</span>

A theoretical model was parametrized with data from a grassland in southern Spain over a growing season. Fitness differences, demographic ratio (the ), competitive response ratio and niche differences.
## Functional drivers of niche and fitness differences across water stress


## Effects of drought-induced phenotypic plasticity on species coexistence

## Implications of competitive interactions for trait assembly patterns


## Conclusions
Species coexistence is dependent on trait variation


Grasslands can be an interesting way to get information on functional traits and competition in a faster way - much more difficult to do in a slow-growing tropical forest!
