It is a very high-risk investment to plant trees for timber:
- very expensive to implement
- a huge loss with saplings that die
- no financial return for a while.

**Secondary forests are NOT valuable based on timber alone**, in comparison with tree plantations.
- Carbon credits are needed to make them valuable, making it possible to bear the cost of transitioning from pastureland to forests.

**Area-based payments**
- shift the risk of loss of carbon sequestration due to droughts/fires/disasters from the farmer to the carbon buyer
- make it possible to keep payments for older forests that grow more slowly and in growth-based metrics become unprofitable

> Carbon payments + timber = win-win for farmers and forests
