>Phosphorus addition had been less evident in less P-limited parts of the neotropics, but in Amazonia it was evident that phosphorus is limiting and more carbon probably won't do much to mature forests.

## Notes:


    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">Recent syntheses have demonstrated that responses to nitrogen addition are as large as to phosphorus2, and adaptations to low phosphorus availability appear to enable net primary productivity to be maintained across major soil phosphorus gradients</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #90EE90">Thus, we established a phosphorus, nitrogen and base cation addition experiment in an old growth Amazon rainforest, with a low soil phosphorus content that is representative of approximately 60% of the Amazon basin. Here we show that net primary productivity increased exclusively with phosphorus addition.</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">After 2 years, strong responses were observed in fine root (+29%) and canopy productivity (+19%), but not stem growth.</span>
    

    

    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">Greater wood productivity has also been observed in forests growing on fertile soils in western Amazonia</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">In Amazonia,fertilizationexperimentshavebeencarriedoutinsecondary forests, but little evidence for strong phosphorus limitation has been observed24,25, with nitrogen availability found to be important during initial forest recovery</span>
    

    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">Therefore, although previous fertilization studies strongly question the ubiquity of phosphorus limitation in tropical forests, their results cannot be extrapolated to Amazonian forests, especially those growing on low-fertility soils in central and eastern regions of the basin.</span>
    

    

    

    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">We have previously observed that base cation addition affects root morphology and mycorrhizal colonization</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">The increase in litterfall productivity at our site appears to result from a decrease in leaf life span, which was estimated to have decreased by 10–20% following phosphorus addition</span>
    

    

    

    

    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">In one of the few studies that measured root productivity responses to large-scale nutrient additions in the tropics, in a secondary seasonally dry tropical forest (approximately 30 years old) in Costa Rica, the addition of phosphorus did stimulate root productivity 1 year after fertilization, but this appeared to be at the expense of aboveground tissue production</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">Whereas plants that grow in high-fertility soils can increase the concentration of nutrients in tissues, with the potential to promote growth44, species in low-fertility sites may be adapted to allocate nutrients to tissues with higher phosphorus demand (more active), prioritizing roots and leaves, increasing photosynthetic and metabolic capacities, promoting ion uptake, tissue growth and maintenance45. In addition, the advantage of higher woody biomass production occurs only if it provides a competitive advantage over neighbouring trees (competition for light) or decreases the risk of mortality</span>
    

    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">. Along a natural soil fertility gradient spanning the Amazon Basin, fine root productivity, measured in the top 30 cm and extended to 1 m depth, increased on average by around 28% and canopy productivity also increased by around 28% from east (less fertile soils) to west47 (high-fertility soils).</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">29.4% stimulation in fine root productivity in our experiment is similar to the difference in fine root productivity between Amazon regions with contrasting soil fertility</span>
    

    

    
> <span style="color: #90EE90">phosphorus limitation may place a stronger constraint on forest responses to rising atmospheric CO2 than nitrogen limitation</span>
