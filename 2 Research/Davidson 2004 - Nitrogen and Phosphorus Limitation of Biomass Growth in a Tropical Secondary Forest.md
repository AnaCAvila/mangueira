## Notes:


    
> <span style="color: #90EE90">first two years’ results of a nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilization experiment in a 6-yr-old secondary forest growing on an abandoned cattle pasture on a clayey Oxisol.</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #90EE90">tree biomass increased significantly following N-only and N 1 P treatments.</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #90EE90">Although P availability is low in these soils and may partially limit biomass growth, the most striking result of this study so far is the significant response of tree growth to N fertilization.</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">Repeated fire and other losses of N from degraded pastures may render tree growth N limited in some young Amazonian forests.</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">In contrast to the grasses, woody tree biomass increased in all plots, but grew faster in the N-only and N 1 P treatments</span>
