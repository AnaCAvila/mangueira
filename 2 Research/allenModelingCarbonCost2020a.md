[[FUN]] is a model of plant nutrient uptake built to be uploaded to [[Earth System Models|ESM]]s.
Models had coupled the C-N biogeochemical cycles, and showed that considering N predicted less [[NPP]] when C-fertilization is happening.

Recent studies show that although tropical soils are P limited, both N and P can affect the tropics.

P and N are co-limiting.

Almost all terrestrial plants are in symbiotic relationships with either arbuscular mycorrhizal or ectomycorrhizal fungi for N and P uptake.

AM is dominant in the tropics, decomposition happens quickly, leafs are flimsier. It's best to be able to absorb things quickly.

ECM is more efficient at low concentrations - it's more carbon-intensive, but uptakes more phosphorus. Makes enzyme to break organic molecules to release both N and P.

Occasionally ECM trees will cluster into stands in the tropics, but that happens much more often in the temperate areas.
also makes it easier to find spores and mycelium
mantle protects the root

In stands, there is sometimes relationships between  MANE micorrhizal associated nutrient economy

baby trees will regenerate away from mother trees because fitness decreases near its neighbors.

Enzymes are made of C and N - so there is a N cost as well as C cost to P uptake

- no storage accounted for - and that is definitely a thing people do.

## Methods

- C cost of P uptake is calculated from P availability and fine root biomass.

As we don't know much about fine roots, this would not 

Nitrogen paradox - there's a lot of a nitrogen, but it's still not enough to get the phosphorus.

Guanacaste is seasonally dry, so it has more soil heterogeneity and it is more  
Palo Verde is sandier and more humid.

Western Amazon has some of the highest leaf resorption rates in the world.

> <span style="color: #FFC0CB">(1) the N cost of P incurs a substantial C cost in tropical systems that drives enhanced N fixation (Figure 4), and (2) P limitation is not only an important process in tropical forests but can also limit NPP through colimitation with N in temperate forests</span>


> <span style="color: #FFC0CB">FUN 3.0 expands upon recent inclusions of P dynamics in ESMs (Wang et al., 2010; Goll et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2014) not only by limiting NPP due to stoichiometric constraints but also by accounting for the C and N invested by plants into acquiring P from soil</span>
