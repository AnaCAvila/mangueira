## Notes:

- Developing nations have decentralized forest management, which has been useful to make the process more seamless (less steps/intermediaries), account for local needs and bypass the middleman that discourages foreign donors to donate.
- Locally managed forests tend to be lower in value - makes sense, the governments want to maintain power over the valueable forests.
- ==Decentralization can make regeneration more beneficial to locals and to nature.==
- Centralizing forest management makes it more expensive to fiscalize and restricts to park boundaries.

- [[REDD+]], however, centralizes forest governance on the government. It requires monitoring and verification of restoration success for proper evaluation of the investment and avoids loss of the initial investment.
- Previous decentralization was greatly due to lack of funding - REDD changes that.
- REDD requires detailed data on emissions reductions which makes it too expensive for small-scale initiatives.
- Locals can help with local data, but it will need to be accounted centrally.
- Also, the value of carbon increases the value of the forest, so the government prefers to keep it central to avoid loss of money - now, the risk is too great.

- Most submissions for REDD funding at World Bank do not consider land tenure and local involvement.
- Companies trying to donate money to get what they want in the end only want cheap carbon and will not really enforce the need for local involvement.
