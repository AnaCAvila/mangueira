#### Notes:
 
> <span style="color: #90EE90">We estimate the age and spatial extent of lowland second-growth forests in the Latin American tropics and model their potential aboveground carbon accumulation over four decades.</span> 

 

 > <span style="color: #F9E076">Four key sources of uncertainty have impeded robust projections of the carbon sequestration potential of naturally regenerating tropical forests:</span>

 

 > <span style="color: #F9E076">the changes over time in aboveground carbon (AGC) storage in SFs under different environmental conditions (rainfall and soil fertility) and land-use history; and (iv) dynamics of agricultural land use and length of fallow cycles</span>

  
> <span style="color: #90EE90">We reduce several of these uncertainties and estimate, for the first time, the carbon sequestration potential of SF regeneration over the entire Latin American tropical lowlands. We derive our projections using an extensive data set on biomass recovery during forest succession (14) and a map of estimated aboveground biomass (AGB) in 2008 derived from wall-to-wall remote sensing coverages (15). We estimate carbon sequestration potential under different scenarios of forest regeneration and pasture abandonment.</span> 

 

 > <span style="color: #F9E076">The carbon sequestration potential revealed by our study is likely an underestimate of the actual potential, for several reasons. Belowground carbon stocks in soils and roots will add 25% or more to total carbon storage (25), but knowledge regarding determinants of successional dynamics of belowground carbon sequestration is insufficient to include in our projections (26). Our study area excludes montane areas of Latin America, where SF is regenerating spontaneously on abandoned farmland (5). Our estimates could be further improved using higherresolution spatial data, which arerapidlybecomingavailable(27), explicitly taking local landscape matrix conditions into account (6), accounting for belowground carbon dynamics (28), and incorporating effects of previous land use on biomass recovery (28, 29). Future projections using more recent baseline data will rely on newer spatial analyses of forest biomass and agricultural land use across Latin America when these become available.</span>

 > <span style="color: #F9E076">To obtain AGB (in megagrams per hectare) for each pixel in our study region, we used the Baccini et al.(15) map for the year 2008,</span>
