## Notes:

The southeast of [[Amazonia]] is a carbon source, and the south is becoming more homogeneous in composition and function.

[[Agroforestry]] and forest economic incentives like [[REDD+]] can be useful.

14% of deforestation over the last 20 years was in indigenous and protected lands.

**Transboundary conservation** - Preserving beyond the boundaries of conservation areas. Biodiversity Financing Initiative encourages:
- ecological fiscal transfers
- payments for environment services
- environmental reserve quotas
- tourism concessions
- [[Agroforestry|Non-Timber Forest Product (NTFP)]] concessions

### 5 tipping points
- 2 degree mean global temperature rise
- 1m of local annual rainfall
- -400mm of maximum [[Cumulative Water Deficit]]
- dry season length of 6 months
- accumulated forest loss of 20%

these can lead to three alternative ecosystems:
- degraded forests
- degraded bistable open canopy ecosystems
- white-sand savannas

depending on the combination of stressors.

### Main solutions
- Protect native vegetation
- Target critical regions (24 cities are responsible for almost half of deforested area since 2016)
- Consider degraded and secondary forests
- Promote governance at local scales
