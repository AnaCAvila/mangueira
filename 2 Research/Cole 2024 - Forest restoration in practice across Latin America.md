## Notes:

Previous studies, many from [[Brancalion, Pedro H. S.|Brancalion, Pedro]], have also studied restoration methods, but not considered cost.

There were many participants from Costa Rica, way more in proportion with its territory. Shows how well restoration is going there, also helps that the study was led by a Costa Rican.
Only one respondent was from Panama. It is expected that timber companies would not respond as much, and timber forests are underrepresented.

### Findings
- Most of the funding came from NGOs, followed by private donors, and in THIRD PLACE the government.
- Selective logging was almost as prevalent in the history of regrowing forests as industrial agriculture
- Cattle ws twice as prevalent as industrial agriculture
- The smallest percentage of projects had to do with timber production - a direct opposite of what we saw in Panama.
- The second smallest percentage of projects involved a health-based motivation
- about one third of projects had food security as a motivator
- The third largest motivator, beyond biodiversity and climate change, was regulating ecosystem services.  
- Remote sensing is most commonly used for monitoring biodiversity
- One third of projects used agroforestry
- The maintenance cost over large timescales can be very high - between 2-5k USD per hectare for 3.5 years
- Maintenance period for tree planting is short when companies are hired with < 4 year funding cycles - the need is to maintain care over the area for longer periods to ensure success

### Main takeaways
- Most restoration initiatives used multiple strategies and had multiple goals
	- active planting predominant
	- natural preferred in large scale
- Costs varied a lot across projects
- Monitoring costs were a big reason why things were so expensive, and often the information from monitoring did not adequately inform on the initial goal of the project (biodiversity, carbon, etc)
