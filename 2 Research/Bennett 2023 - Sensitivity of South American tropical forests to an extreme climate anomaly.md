> <span style="color: #90EE90">The tropical forest carbon sink is known to be drought sensitive, but it is unclear which forests are the most vulnerable to extreme events. Forests with hotter and drier baseline conditions may be protected by prior adaptation, or more vulnerable because they operate closer to physiological limits. Here we report that forests in drier South American climates experienced the greatest impacts of the 2015–2016 El Niño, indicating greater vulnerability to extreme temperatures and drought.

> <span style="color: #90EE90">In this Article, we assessed the impact of the 2015–2016 El Niño on South American tropical forests using 123 long-term monitoring plots in the RAINFOR and PPBio networks, the largest on-the-ground dataset yet mobilized to address the impact of a single tropical drought.

> <span style="color: #F9E076">In pro - portional terms, while mortality rates increased by 50% in the smallest trees, they doubled in the larger size classes.</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">Additionally, trees with greater wood density were at less risk of mortality throughout, and this effect was strengthened during the El Niño.</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">impacts were exacerbated where it was both hotter and drier.</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">Larger trees are inherently more vulnerable to climate extremes because of their size, with greater tension needed to move water longer distances, wider vessels and greater risk of cavitation</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">Larger trees also may have a more exposed position 27 and therefore experience the most extreme temperatures and vapour pressure deficits.</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">Enhanced mortality of larger trees during drought is widely attributed to hydraulic failure e28 , 29, , a risk that is greater for fast-growing, lower-wood-density trees</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">in contrast to the impact of drought on forests, it was the magnitude of the temperature anomaly itself rather than the tem - perature baseline that increased carbon losses</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">repeated exposure to drought has caused no loss of intact forest resistance to drought, and although the 2015–2016 El Niño was the hottest drought ever in the Amazon, there is no evidence that its impacts are stronger than those of previous droughts</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">Ground observational records of climate anomaly impacts on for - ests are essential to complement top-down observations and analyses.</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">satellites track near real-time carbon losses, while our analysis includes committed losses due to mortality that are not immediately released to the atmosphere, and atmospheric measurements include net soil carbon fluxes, which are not our focus.</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">Another study using satellite-sensed CO 2 estimated that, compared with the La Niña year of 2011, South American forests had a net emission of 0.9 Pg C due to reduced productivity or higher respiration in 2015 during the El Niño</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">Liu et al. (2017) (ref. 35 ) attribute the apparent decline in growth to lower precipitation, but our ground measurements indicate that drier pre-El Niño baseline climates, as well as the temperature anomaly, reduced net carbon via increased aboveground biomass mortality rather than reducing biomass growth</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">South American tropical forests there - fore appear to be more sensitive to El Niño events than African forests.</span>
