## Notes

Conversion to pasture or slash-and-burn showed an effect on pH, bulk density, and exchangeable Ca concentrations. 

Studied mature, secondary, pasture, SC, and tree crops. 

Extractable soil P was equally low on pasture and forest. 

Surface C:N ratios were different across pastureland that was kept as pasture for different amounts of time. Pasture had more total C and N than other land uses. 

Recuperating C and N from shifting cultivation is slow. 

Soil C, N and P are strongly related to clay content. 

Data could not quantify the magnitude of change in soil nutrient pools. 

Increased compaction, ph and exchangeable Ca.
