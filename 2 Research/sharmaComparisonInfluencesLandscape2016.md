> <span style="color: #F9E076">Case studies of social-ecological landscapes that consider local, spatially explicit land cover changes are necessary for the development of generalised knowledge on deforestation.</span>
    

    

    

    
> <span style="color: #90EE90">number of people at home and household land ownership, are constraining variables on land cover and help explain divergent forest cover</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #90EE90">Future land management could therefore benefit from establishment of a local non-governmental organisation to coordinate a communal vision of management and harness external conservation resources.</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">landscapes emerge from an array of environmental and human interactions.</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">This request provided a unique opportunity to identify combinations of social-ecological factors that drive deforestation.</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">. First, we determined whether the two territories in eastern Panama do indeed have divergent landscapes in terms of current forest cover and recent deforestation rates. We then identified which social-ecological, historical and governance factors that shape the landscapes, namely the Resource System’s topography, Actor household socioeconomics, Resource Unit’s historical quality and the Governance Structure, taken from Ostrom’s framework, were different between the communities and could explain divergent forest cover.</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">Six per cent of the cases examined in a meta-analysis identified topography and slope as “predisposing” explanatory factors of deforestation in Latin America</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">In an analysis of forest cover change in the Chorotega region of Costa Rica, secondary forest tended to be in areas of high slope and low soil depth and fertility, where pasture establishment would not be viable</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">This participatory project stemmed from local leaders’ concern that land cover did not correspond to the landscape they wanted.</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">In particular, we found that a potential pathway for reforestation exists via enhancement of the Governance Structure, namely the creation of a local NGO that creates a communal vision of and funnels resources for forest conservation.</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #90EE90">Local leaders in the forest-poor territory should therefore be reassured that it was not simply household-level decision-making that led to disparate landscapes, and that there is room to form alliances to move the landscape in the trajectory they desire.</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">Participants were asked to divide 20 pebbles between each land cover category for each decade from the 1970s until the 2010s to represent the composition of the territories over time.</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">They claimed that the drop in forest cover in the 1990s was partly due to allotment of previously ownerless lands by local leaders to new, landless families.</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">The former finding prompted us to interview key informants in both communities</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">Thus, given the evidence for selective logging in the Bayano and, particularly, in Piriatí, we hypothesise that the communities did not have perfectly equivalent landscapes at the time of settlement circa 1980.</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">The timeline illustrates how Piriatí and Ipetí share similar histories of land use conflict and ecological incidents, but Ipetí has had a stronger history of local governance and collaboration with outsiders.</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">After a decade of scientific research in Ipetí, the relationship with CP led to sale of carbon under a voluntary carbon project and agroforestry reforestation with STRI in 2008</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">reforestation by government and NGOs (specifically, Global Brigades) has been at a small scale, focused on people rather than landscape-level land use</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">landowners leaving forest in areas of high slope and elevation</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">The analysis therefore suggests that partial divergence in the landscapes can be attributed to differences in the biophysical context of the territories, rather than disparities in decision-making.</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">Piriatí had more people per household than Ipetí</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">Firstly, the inherited quality of the Resource Unit likely influenced the perceived value of maintaining Resource Units (i.e. forests)</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">Inheriting already degraded forests in Piriatí due to historical timber extraction by the government pre-settlement may have incentivised forest clearing compared to in Ipetí, where forests were reportedly primary at the time of establishment</span>
    


    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">location on flat areas conducive to forest clearing, but also inheritance of land that was already degraded due to being located closer to a centre of timber extraction</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">qualitative analysis of historical events, illustrating harvesting by local landowners leading to forest loss, supports the aforementioned influence of subsistence needs derived from quantitative analysis</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #90EE90">A similar transition to that in Piriatí has been anticipated in Ipetí</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">current forest cover has been shaped by the external political setting that enabled a local politician (as well as the national government) to harvest, clear forest and degrade the land in the past</span>
    


    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">few landowners own the majority of pasture and local community members who have sold or rented lands look after these landowners’ cattle</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">past collaboration between outside and local institutions in carbon projects and later agroforestry may help explain differences in forest cover</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">this initial scientific relationship enabled subsequent collaboration in reforestation and agroforestry with external NGOs in Ipetí</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">community members (particularly women) in Piriatí, where there is no such active NGO, previously alleged that weak internal laws and lack of social organisation in the community – and thus lack of a cohesive, communal vision of land management – were factors that have led to forest loss in their territory</span>
