## Notes:

STRI and McGill invested in carbon offsets in Ipetí. About half of the money was spent on avoided deforestation.

Of the families that joined, some planted timber species and some also added fruit trees for subsistence, in a stratified agroforestry system including palms, fruit trees and timber trees.

### Conclusion
The arguments that the incentives increased income and well being for the people involved are unclear.
- There is a large range of income acquired and initial income of the people in the project - means don't really say much about what is going on in individual cases.
- Differences in planting practices and income sources makes results more confusing to interpret. The most informative table brings in data from only two people in each income bracket. It does show a large increase in income in 2018, which is when the final payment was made, but it does not convince if regular payments are proportional to the work and investment spent to start and maintain the reforestation projects, and compensate for the loss of income of other activities that these people would have invested on otherwise.
- Agroforestry is still the smallest cover of all land uses.
- People will continue the project going because there is no value in cutting down fruit trees, and timber species must be cut down after they're 25+ years old anyways.
- This is a project that is only really feasible for the wealthier members of the community, that have the option to take a riskier investment than cattle, for example.

Overall, I remain unconvinced that this project will support a consistent improvement in quality of life of the Emberá, and even less have any ecological impact. The only thing that this may be more helpful is avoiding deforestation, but even then it becomes an excuse for the buyers of carbon credits to pollute.
