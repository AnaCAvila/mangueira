## Notes:

Identity of tree, besides diversity, makes a difference in C storage. 

As biodiversity increases, the links between different C pools increases. 

“Many studies examining the effect of tree diversity on productivity or C storage used aboveground tree biomass as a surrogate for net primary productivity (NPP: the total production of plant biomass within a given time period) ([Catovsky et al., 2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112710006857?fr=RR-2&ref=pdf_download&rr=7259fd91ea4e4bb8%22%20\l%20%22bib0025)). NPP is a good indicator of ecosystem C storage only if large-scale disturbances during a specific period can be ruled out, because C is lost through heterotrophic respiration, fire and other disturbances such as human harvest ([Körner, 2000](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112710006857?fr=RR-2&ref=pdf_download&rr=7259fd91ea4e4bb8%22%20\l%20%22bib0110),[Körner, 2003](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112710006857?fr=RR-2&ref=pdf_download&rr=7259fd91ea4e4bb8%22%20\l%20%22bib0115),[Schlesinger and Lichter, 2001](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112710006857?fr=RR-2&ref=pdf_download&rr=7259fd91ea4e4bb8%22%20\l%20%22bib0220),[Schulze et al., 2000](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112710006857?fr=RR-2&ref=pdf_download&rr=7259fd91ea4e4bb8%22%20\l%20%22bib0230)).” 

Effects of biodiversity beyond biomass measures of carbon – soil C pool, fluxes of C. 

We estimated NPP as the change in aboveground biomass of four different biomass compartments (trees, litter, herbaceous and CWD) between consecutive years. NPP was therefore calculated from biomass increment for the 2006–2007 (NPP2007) and the 2007–2009 (NPP2009) intervals. 

Increases in the tree C pool happened as there was a decrease in soil C pool.
