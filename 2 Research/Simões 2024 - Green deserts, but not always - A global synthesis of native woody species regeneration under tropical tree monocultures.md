## Notes:

### Methods
Systematic review on native species regeneration.

Used WebPlotDigitizer to get data from figures and TreeCo database for reference forests.

Maintained studies with reference area, and calculated a log-response ratio for both richness and abundance.

> It is interesting that they are considering pine and eucalyptus understory, when Jeff mentioned that in Panama farmers usually clear the understory while it regenerates.


After 20 years of regrowth, biodiversity still isn't
