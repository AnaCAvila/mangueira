>Based on plot data across different biomes, it shows predictions for the whole world based on 66 environmental predictors.

>[!quote] Cited
>The effects of land use (pasture, shifting, long-term cropping, fire) were significant across biomes, but indistinguishable within biomes. The classification however is quite coarse and there is a lot of unexplained variability.
