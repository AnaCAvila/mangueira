## Notes:
Burned forests are nitrogen poor and burning does not increase nitrogen fixation. 

Expect burning to reduce fertilization, but there should still be biomass accumulation. 

N fixation was significantly low for both burned and unburned forests 7 years post fire. Soils are rich in N, which would explain low N fixation. 

There were MORE FIXATING TREE SPECIES, but those species were not fixating much
