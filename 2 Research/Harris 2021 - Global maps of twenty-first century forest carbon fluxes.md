### Mismatch between carbon uptake estimates
- National Greenhouse Gas inventories estimate CO2 emissions *way lower than the IPCC.* This could be due to:
	- including different things as anthropogenic forest sinks
	- *mismatches across and within countries* that make it hard to synthesize local measurements into one global value.

### CO2 source and sink
- from 2001 to 2009, *forests absorbed 2x the carbon that they emitted due to degradation/deforestation.*
- 27% of the world's forest carbon sink is in protected areas
- tropical forests store 1.5x more carbon than temperate forests
- tropical and subtropical forests account for most removals (55%), but also most emissions (78%)
	- as a consequence, temperate forests contributed to 2/3 of the global net sink.
- The Brazilian Amazon has been a source for a while. The whole Amazon, however, was still a weak sink by 2019.

### Scale and land use practices matter
- carbon emission at the local scale can be balanced out at the landscape scale

### Mature forests are still most important
- secondary forests less than 19 years old represent less than 5% of the world's carbon sink
	- the paper argues for the protection of older secondary forests, which makes sense - but they also cover MUCH more area than younger secondary forests for the year 2000, to my surprise. Granted, this is for the whole tropics, and the trend could be different locally.

### Methods
Data from [[Hansen 2013 - Global Forest Change]] and a methodology from the IPCC was used to make a worldwide carbon map. They considered land use metrics such as fire and forest type.

- Estimates were reduced by 12% when the [[Saatchi]] 1km data was used, instead of the 30m biomass data developed in this paper.
- **Detection of clearings smaller than 6 hectares is important.**
