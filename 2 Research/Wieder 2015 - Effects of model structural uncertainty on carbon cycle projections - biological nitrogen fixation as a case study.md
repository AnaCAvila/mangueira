Model structural uncertainty on carbon cycle projections

Wieder, 2015

Future productivity and carbon storage limited by terrestrial nutrient availability (Wieder et al 2015) shows that N and P limit carbon uptake.

Effects of model structural uncertainty on carbon cycle projections –

biological nitrogen fixation as a case study

- What does structural uncertainty mean in this context, and why is it important to consider model structural uncertainties?

- Increased complexity of models brings increased uncertainty

- terrestrial carbon, plant productivity, carbon turnover - all hard to tell

- Adding nitrogen to the models can make models more realistic, but increase their uncertainty. They're closer to reality, but less reliable/accurate......

- Why is it so difficult to accurately represent biological nitrogen fixation in models? What are some of the unknowns associated with BNF?

- not enough empirical measurements
- not enough understanding on its biophysics

- usually use evapotranspiration and net primary production only

- What are the main ways that biological nitrogen fixation is represented in the land- surface models tested in this study?

- NPP driven and evapotranspiration.

- What happened when BNF was represented in different ways? Based on the findings from this study, how much does changing the model representation of BNF matter?

- NPP estimates are 15% higher than ET estimates in general, but higher in ET estimates in arid and tropical (southern hemisphere) environments. Total BNF is higher in the tropics regardless.
- CASA estimated either very high or very low BNF.
- ET estimates of BNF are much lower since more CO2 requires more N and terrestrial N, without NPP, is not able to maintain that supply. Global NPP is expected to decrease and therefore carbon sink also decreases (less forests and algae), meaning less of a carbon sink.

- The authors suggest a few different ways to improve model representation of BNF. Which suggestions do you think are the most promising? Can you think of other research strategies that could reduce structural uncertainty in BNF – what questions or unknowns do you think would be the most important to know, measure, or test?

- The model does not represent disturbances
- model-data fusion to improve model certainty

- finding out what parameters best fit the real life observations and quantify their uncertainty
- acquiring more data
- finding where data should be collected and how model can be improved (duh)
