## Notes:


 > <span style="color: #F9E076">Globally, 40% of terrestrial biomass C is in tropical forests (Dixon et al. 1994), and 40% of this is in secondary forests</span>

 

 > <span style="color: #F9E076">n tropical America and Africa, most secondary forests originated from agricultural fallows. In tropical Asia, logging was a more important contributor to secondary forest formation than agricultural abandonmen</span>

 

 > <span style="color: #F9E076">At the time of their review, 58% of secondary forests in tropical America were first generation secondary forests,</span>

 

 > <span style="color: #F9E076">years. Soil fertility can be an important factor affecting forest regeneration. Tropical soils are typically old, highly weathered Ultisols and Oxisols that are poor in mineral-derived nutrients such as phosphorous, calcium, and other base cations (Brady and Weil 2002). Prior land uses such as repeated fire and long-term pasture use may also lead to losses of nitrogen from soils</span>
