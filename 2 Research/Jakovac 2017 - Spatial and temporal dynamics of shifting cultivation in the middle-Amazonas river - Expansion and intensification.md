 > <span style="color: #F9E076">Studies have shown that agricultural intensification, i.e. higher number ofswidden-fallow cycles and shorter fallow periods, reduces crop productivity ofswiddens and the regrowth capacity offallows, undermining the resilience ofthe shifting cultivation system as awhole.</span>

  
> <span style="color: #90EE90">We investigated the temporal and spatial dynamics ofshifting cultivation inBrazilian Amazonia totest the hypotheses that (i) agriculture has become more intensive over time, and (ii) patterns ofland-use intensity are related toland accessibility and human population density.</span> 

  

> <span style="color: #FFC0CB">Our results indicate that shifting cultivation inriverine Amazonia has gone through aprocess ofagricultural intensification inthe past three decades. The resulting landscape ispredominantly covered by young secondary forests (  12 yrs old), and 20% ofithave gone through intensive use.</span>
