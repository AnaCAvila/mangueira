### Radiometers
Measures the intensity of radiation in some bands within the spectrum. Can cover different portions of the spectrum (visible, IR, microwave)
- [[ECOSTRESS]] (thermal infrared)
- [[VIIRS]]
- GOES
- *Visible* : Can show whether clouds are thicker or thinner, and where they turn to become hurricanes.
- *Infrared* : Can be used to distinguish low and high clouds, as low clouds are warmer. IR is available both day and night. 
- *Water vapor* : between 6.500 nm and 6.900 nm (lower infrared, but not usually noticeable by IR imagery, which is higher)
