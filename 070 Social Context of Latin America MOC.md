Cacao agroforestry may be a viable substitute to monocultures in Latin America. Potential research idea - if there is a way to quantify the large-scale ability of the forest to provide fruit and to maintain itself with healthy carbon cycling over a large period, we could quantify potential profits of agroforestry over monocultures.
	Main issue is whether these products would be exportable - who would buy very expensive cacao? - and whether carbon credits can be used in the 3 years that it takes cacao to reach maturity.

Also timber may be a good idea? [[bongersPotentialSecondaryForests2015]] says it can be managed in a way to maximize C uptake!

## Disturbance and Disease

**Aim 4 – We model disease presence given secondary forest age and land use history.** Dengue fever is a prominent issue in Latin America, and mosquito abundance and preference to human targets has been shown to be correlated with disturbance rates12.  We hypothesize that more disturbed areas will show more presence of Aedes mosquitoes, and more Dengue cases in Panama. To test this hypothesis, we are collaborating with a research team that has collected mosquito larvae in households across Panama13,14, as well as the Panamanian Ministry of Health (MINSA) who has monitored mosquito occurrence and dengue cases across the country, and Dr. Javier Galan-Sanchez, long involved in bioinformatics and health research. We will use frequency of land cover changes (transitions between anthropogenic vs. forested land), number of burns, and age of surrounding secondary forest as predictors for mosquito and disease occurrence. With this, we can build a map with probability of presence of the Aedes mosquito, as well as potential for dengue infection, given historical land use change and current forest cover. **Impact:** With this, we can establish a linkage between environmental disturbance and human health, with the populations more at risk living near disturbed areas, such as rural and indigenous peoples. This can help predict zoonoses outbreaks given deforestation, improving management of resources to combat disease and highlighting the importance of conservation for human health.
