### Summary written for Professor Tober English 1301 28 January 2016

In “Household Horror: Domestic Masculinity in Poe’s ‘The Black Cat´,” Ann Bliss analyzes the domestic violence committed by the story’s narrator “through the lens of gender construction,” to argue it is motivated and escalated by his sense of “failed masculinity” (96).

Bliss first explains that the narrator’s sense of “failed masculinity” is rooted in “feminine traits” he exhibited as a child (96). He cares for his pets in an “almost maternal” way, demonstrating kindness. Being caring is typically a female trait. Also, he gives up on the friendship of other men for his relationship with the animals, referring to the first as “paltry”. He considers his pets more faithful than males his age, demonstrating a lack of sense of community with other men. Furthermore, his wife’s relationship with the animals reinforces that, since the only person in which he could find a similar tendency for taking care of animals was a female (96).

Bliss then explains that marriage exacerbates the narrator’s sense of “failed masculinity” and, therefore, instigates and escalates domestic violence against his wife and pets, especially his first black cat, Pluto (97). He has no children and seems to be unemployed. A married male of his time was supposed to provide for his family and have children of his own for his wife to watch over; his inability to do that consists on a failure to fulfill the obligations of a man. He tries to find this lost sense of masculinity in perverseness and violence, stating that it gives “direction to the character of Man” and killing Pluto because he didn’t love him anymore. The narrator believes Pluto learned to see the failure that he became and lost respect for him; therefore, killing the cat was a way to destroy the only individual who, from his point of view, was aware of his biggest shame (97).

Finally, Bliss explains that the affection the narrator’s second black cat displays for him threatens his sense of “masculine power” restored by killing the first black cat and symbolizes the resulting “hypermasculine” domestic violence that will culminate in the narrator’s murder of his wife (97-98). The black cat shows affection for him, reminding him of his previous cat (who he killed to reassure his masculinity) and requesting caresses, which are a part of the feminine side he’s trying to suppress. It’s a threat to his feeling of masculine power he acquired through violence (98). His wife tries to keep him from killing the cat, which from his point of view is a way for him to get rid of the constant reminder of his femininity and an act of hypermasculinity in itself. Seeing his authority questioned by a female, he kills her, the most violent act he ever performed and therefore a confirmation for himself of his so desired “masculine power”.
