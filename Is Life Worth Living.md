My first thought is that nature is cruel and unfair. Like I studied in university, there is so much suffering in nature, and no point in any of this. Pain evolved as a way of self-preservation, and then some animals evolve self-awareness, and suffer emotional and psychological pain besides physical.

>Â Nature here is vile and base. I wouldn't see anything erotical here. I would see fornication and asphyxiation and choking and fighting for survival and... growing and... just rotting away. Of course, there's a lot of misery. But it is the same misery that is all around us. The trees here are in misery, and the birds are in misery. I don't think they - they sing. They just screech in pain.
