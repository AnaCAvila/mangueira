### **General Advice for Organizing and Studying Articles**
1. **Tagging in Zotero**:
   - Use consistent tags for key themes like `forest regrowth`, `biodiversity`, `climate impact`, `restoration techniques`, and `policy implications`.
   - Add sub-tags as necessary, such as `succession stages`, `carbon sequestration`, or `species interactions`.

2. **Reading Approach**:
   - **Prioritize foundational papers** in each theme, as they provide a baseline understanding and often set the stage for later studies.
   - **Move sequentially through each theme** from basic to advanced studies, ensuring a clear understanding of each area before moving on.
   - **Regularly revisit key findings** and update tags or notes in Zotero to keep track of insights that are crucial for your Ph.D. research.

3. **Taking Notes**:
   - Summarize key points, methodologies, and limitations for each article, and categorize them in Zotero or a document for easy reference.
   - Use color coding or annotations to highlight research gaps, which may provide inspiration for future studies or your dissertation focus.

4. **Regular Reviews**:
   - Periodically review your notes and summaries, especially before beginning a new chapter or section in your research.
   - This will reinforce the connections between themes and help in synthesizing information for comprehensive understanding.
