Including all GHGs, emissions are 30% higher than considering just carbon.
3/4 of emissions are coming from energy - coal, oil, to generate electricity, heat houses and power vehicles.

an 1.2% decrease per year should keep us below 2 degrees of

GDP/Pop -> per capita income
energy/GDP -> energy intensity of output
CO2/energy - carbon efficiency

Very much a pro-capitalist view - openly, directly so.
- arguing for a reduction in population, and arguing that it is an inherent part of humanity to want more than they have.
The concern is, I do disagree with him on this - but much of the world agrees. and such a drastic mentality change.

- The question is HOW. We do need a big change on how the global north consumes, and for that we need conversations with psychologists, social scientists.

the emissions in north america are coming from the wealthy. and those dont care about costs!! kylie jenner famously takes 30 min flights instead of driving!

I could maybe see this working out for some industries?

The idea that this can encourage industries to reduce emissions makes sense to me. I believe that as long as this is focused more on actually reducing the emissions from large industries, and if policies are engineered in a way to reduce the costs from the bottom, it makes sense.

My only concern is that the kylies of the world will still not give a shit - separate issue.

Also my concern is carbon emission exportations. A big reason why canadians also dont do agriculture as much anymore is bc all the food is coming from the south. if they do the classic of "it's too expensive to emit here, I'll go emit in the Phillipines", we're fucked.

Conclusion: carbon tax is useful, but not enough, and must be implemented wisely.

## Reasons why climate change is so hard to solve
1 - It takes more than just eliminating our GHG emissions. Emitted CO2 takes decades in the atmosphere.

We have:
- technological challenges
- economic challenges
- political challenges
- legal/social challenges
