Field inventory plots are expensive, difficult to maintain, and don't show heterogeneity.Â 

Mapped ACD - Aboveground Carbon Density using field plots, airborne LiDAR and Landsat at hectare scale.Â 

ðŸ’¡ The hectare is the most common unit, and is reliable for estimating errors in carbon stocks.Â 

Top of canopy height was measured at 1.1 m resolution, and it estimated ACD with high predictive power in relation to data collected from the ground (units Mg C /ha).Â 

Error of 10% in relation to field plots is within margin of error of field plots alone.Â 

ACD = 0.359 TCH^{1.7676}Â 

(field estimated ACD vs lidar estimated TCH)Â 

R squared was even higher among validation plots than on calibration plots (there's also fewer validation plots).Â 

Validation plots were used for national upscaling using satellite data. With decision tree, the nationwide upscaling was better (lower bias comparing nationwide to lidar scale data).Â 

The allometry to estimate biomass used wood density and taxonomy.Â 

What is the resolution?Â
