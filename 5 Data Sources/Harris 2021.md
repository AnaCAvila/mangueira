Global Forest Watch Biomass data.

Overestimated at low values, overestimated at high values. Aboveground biomass was estimated using a multi-step process of calculating AGB at more than seven hundred thousand points with LiDAR with regional allometric equations, then using those to train a wall-to-wall model based on Landsat imagery.  Built from [[Baccini 2012]] methodology.
