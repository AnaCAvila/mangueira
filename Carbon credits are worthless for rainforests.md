>[!note] Summary
>Leading offset company is selling inflated carbon credits and displacing vulnerable communities. Companies should fund conservation initiatives rather than buy offsets.

**Verra** is the company operating the world's main carbon standard.

[Rainforest carbon credit schemes misleading and ineffective](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/sep/15/rainforest-carbon-credit-schemes-misleading-and-ineffective-finds-report?CMP=share_btn_tw)
**Berkeley Carbon Trading Project** studies carbon trading and offset initiatives. Based on [[REDD+]] projects (durability, forest carbon accounting, community safeguards, deforestation leakage, and baselines), they found Verra had none of those up to standards.
- original communities were displaced
- there was no safeguarding that deforestation was just going to be pushed elsewhere
- environmental risks were overplayed so the amount paid was too great for the benefits gained *(inflated credits)*

> “The research shows that the current rules governing [[REDD+]] projects seriously lack credibility and cannot be trusted to generate high quality carbon credits. Businesses are offsetting their emissions on the cheap by buying low-quality carbon credits connected to forest protection projects in the Global South,” said Inigo Wyburd, a policy expert on global carbon markets at Carbon Market Watch.

> “Offsetting should be axed. It cannot work in its current form, and carbon markets must evolve into something different. The focus should be on getting money to the right place, rather than getting as many credits as possible,” said Gilles Dufrasne, policy lead on global carbon markets for CMW.

[Revealed: more than 90% of rainforest carbon offsets by biggest certifier are worthless, analysis shows](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/18/revealed-forest-carbon-offsets-biggest-provider-worthless-verra-aoe)
- over 90% of Verra's rainforest credits showed no evidence of deforestation reductions in studies done by The Guardian, Die Zeit, and University of Cambridge.
- Verra set their own predictions of how much deforestation their own projects will stop.
- The formula for carbon sequestered by area does not consider differences in forest type.
- "deforestation reductions" were claimed by just comparing one area to another that contains a road - evidently the road will lead to more deforestation!
