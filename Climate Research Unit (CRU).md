[Version 4 of the CRU TS monthly high-resolution gridded multivariate climate dataset](https://www-nature-com.proxy3.library.mcgill.ca/articles/s41597-020-0453-3)

Potential [[Evapotranspiration]] (PET) is calculated using the Penman-Monteith formula described in [Ekstrom et al 2007](https://hal.science/hal-00305649/), so using grass as reference.

For this we use the CRU TS gridded values of mean temperature, vapour pressure, cloud cover and static (temporally invariant except for the annual cycle) 1961â€“90 average wind field values.
