- Summary of anthropogenic effects on the forest. Land use change is relevant. Science Panel for the Amazon Assessment Report is mentioned.

[[Aragão 2007 - Spatial patterns and fire response of recent Amazonian droughts]]
- Different droughts affect regions of the amazon basin differently - ENSO has a greater impact in N, center and E Amazon, and hydrological stresses affect SW amazon more since NW has high background precipitation rates. SW is more vulnerable.


Patterns of climate in the Amazon

Regeneration vs regrowth vs restoration 

Degredation vs deforestation vs disturbance

1. Dry vs wet tropical forests.

1. Total biomass, different growth rates. Would that be redundant with rainfall seasonality?

3. Northern Amazon is wetter, so it feels less the effect of fire. How does the model incorporate this knowledge?

## Restoration efforts
