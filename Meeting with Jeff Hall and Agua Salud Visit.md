Some quadrants measure all trees above 5 cm, others measure all trees above 1 cm. 

- Presence of palm trees may be an important factor when estimating forest biomass, as they take a lot of space and do not store much carbon. Is that considered when algorithms calculate biomass from lidar/SAR?
- Would be helpful to look into high resolution biomass data (such as Asner, but maybe more) and their values per age for Agua Salud, and compare that with the 2020 values.
- S2BaK / Agua Salud - Distribution of species changes with plot, possibly depending on surrounding forest cover.
- Surrounding mature forest cover probably has more of an effect on older secondary forests, as that is where the seeds for late succession species come from. It could be that they don't supply enough seeds of early succession species, and according to Mario Bail√≥n, after 5 years you already see a solid presence of mature forest species, so the dynamics in the very first years may not be strongly dependent on mature forest biomass.
- Some plots have remnant trees, that were left behind by pastureland, and others are regrowing on completely clear cut areas. Plots with remnant trees may also regenerate much faster, and those older trees may hold a lot of the biomass.

## Lianas
Every plot measures lianas. Number and size of individual branches is measured in each 5x5m quadrant. Liana diversity/abundance changes with age
