> [!note] Summary
Rioterra and The Black Jaguar Foundation are successful NGOs looking to plant trees.

- Forest restoration needs to occur over a jungle area twice the size of Germany, according to Carlos Nobre, one of Brazil’s most prominent climate scientists. The price tag: more than $20 billion, he estimates.
- Government data show that about three soccer fields’ worth of virgin forest was cleared every minute in 2022. Illegal invaders destroy in hours what it takes Rioterra or Black Jaguar a year to plant.

## How the NGOs work
- Seems like in Brazil there are good forest protection laws - they just need to be enforced.

> “Brazil is millions of miles ahead of the vast majority of other countries” in having a reforestation framework in place, said Cristina Banks-Leite, a tropical ecologist at Imperial College London.

- By providing free trees, Black Jaguar managed to convince Bolsominion families to plant trees in their farmland, which is damn impressive.
- Rioterra and Black Jaguar use passive [[Regrowth]] when possible.
- They are funded by private donors, as charity and as **carbon offsets.**
- They also get death threats - [[Standing Firm]]
