- if campaign is funded, 6-9 year campaign

PANGEA ([https://tropicalforestscoping.com/](https://tropicalforestscoping.com/)) will build on NASA's previous campaigns to investigate how climate and land-use change affect tropical forests within and between continents. PANGEA will combine in-situ field data with remotely sensed airborne and spaceborne data to: 1. Examine similarities and differences in forest composition, structure, and biogeochemical cycling across tropical regions. 2. Evaluate the vulnerability and resilience of tropical forest ecosystems to global change. 3. Guide decision-making to support societal responses to climate change mitigation, adaptation, and biodiversity conservation.    

**Scope of this Working Group (WG):**

Tropical forests vary widely within and among regions in their ecosystem structure, function, and biodiversity, and this variation influences responses to climate and land use change. Spaceborne remote sensing can quantify this variation over space and time, and thereby contribute to major improvements in understanding and modeling of tropical forests.  However, accurate interpretation requires a concerted effort to link satellite retrievals with ground and airborne measurements for calibration and validation. A NASA terrestrial ecology field campaign offers the opportunity to greatly improve our ability to quantify tropical forest structure, function and diversity from remote sensing; to advance our understanding of how structure, function, and diversity vary and covary among tropical forests; to improve the representation of tropical forests in biosphere models; and ultimately improve our understanding of tropical forest ecosystems and their responses to global change.  

**Goal of this WG:**

Like all the PANGEA science theme working groups, our overall goals are to identify key knowledge gaps, evaluate how a NASA-funded multi-scale, multi-year campaign in the tropics could potentially address these gaps, and make recommendations on associated research priorities for a campaign. This will, in part, involve assessing what aspects of tropical forest ecosystem structure, function, and diversity are currently or potentially observable with remote sensing; evaluating the potential to address the major science questions and inform improvements in the representation of tropical forests in earth system models with such data (specifically including potential to improve representation of plant functional diversity); and identifying associated needs and options for collection of complementary airborne and field data including but not limited to those needed for calibration and validation of space-based remote sensing products. The recommendations for research priorities should speak to the overall goals of NASA field campaigns to answer big science questions, enable more effective interpretation and analysis of space-based measurements, and leave a legacy data set of great value for future research.

NASA will pay for community workshops
