## Active Sensors
[[LiDAR]] and [[SAR]] are active remote sensing systems that allow the detection of [[Biomass]].
### LiDAR
- [[GEDI]]
- [[ICESat1 - GLAS & ICESat2 - ATLAS]]
- [[Asner ACD]]
### SAR
- [[ESA CCI Biomass]]
- [[Sentinel 1]]
- [[NISAR]]
- [[ASAR-ESA]]
- [[PALSAR - ALOS]]

## Passive Sensors
### Multispectral
[[Multispectral]] is a passive remote sensing system that allows [[Land Use]] Classification and [[Fire]] detection.
- [[Landsat]]
- [[MODIS]]
- [[Planet]]
- [[Sentinel 2]]
- [[Maxar]]
- [[Airbus]]
### Hyperspectral
- [[Hyperion]]
- [[HyspIRI]]
### Spectrometers
![[110 Remote Sensing-1.png]]
![[110 Remote Sensing-2.png]]
Analyzes the spectral content of radiation. Can help find out the composition of things - in this case, three rock types that were noticeable as they absorb different parts of the spectrum, but that was impossible to tell with Landsat.

- [[MERIS]]

### Radiometers
Measures the intensity of radiation in some bands within the spectrum. Can cover different portions of the spectrum (visible, IR, microwave)
- [[ECOSTRESS]] (thermal infrared)
- [[VIIRS]]
- GOES
- Visible : Can show whether clouds are thicker or thinner, and where they turn to become hurricanes.
- Infrared : Can be used to distinguish low and high clouds, as low clouds are warmer. IR is available both day and night. 
- Water vapor : between 6.500 nm and 6.900 nm (lower infrared, but not usually noticeable by IR imagery, which is higher)

## Other facts
- **Larger wavelengths require larger apertures for same resolution**
	![[110 Remote Sensing-3.png]]
- **Plants reflect near-infrared very strongly!**
		And that reflectance changes with the season/growth stage... possibly also species??
- **We need atmospheric correction!**
		Much energy is absorbed and reflected by the atmosphere.

- **It's hard to find something with high spectral, temporal AND spatial resolution**
		Landsat has high resolution, but only returns every 16 days. MODIS, on the other hand, returns every 1-2 days, but has a 500m resolution

Solved with constellations, such as [[Airbus]], [[Planet]] and [[Maxar]].
