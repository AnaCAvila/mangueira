## Active Sensors
[[LiDAR]] and [[SAR]] are active remote sensing systems that allow the detection of [[Biomass]].
### LiDAR
- [[GEDI]]
- [[ICESat1 - GLAS & ICESat2 - ATLAS]]
- [[Asner ACD]]
### SAR
- [[ESA CCI Biomass]]
- [[Sentinel 1]]
- [[NISAR]]
- [[ASAR-ESA]]
- [[PALSAR - ALOS]]
*Scatterometers* use radar to measure backscatter due to ocean wind and direction.
## Passive Sensors
### Multispectral
Is a passive remote sensing system that allows [[Land Use]] Classification and [[Fire]] detection.

- [[Landsat]]
- [[MODIS]]
- [[Planet]]
- [[Sentinel 2]]
- [[Maxar]]
- [[Airbus]]
### Hyperspectral
![[110 Remote Sensing-5.png]]
Finds hundreds of very narrow bands on visible, near-IR and mid-IR, so higher spectral resolution.
- [[Hyperion]]
- [[HyspIRI]]
- PROBA-1 (ESA) in 2001
- PRISMA (Italy) in 2019
- EnMap (Germany) in 2020
- HISUI (Japan) in 2020
They are not very commonly used because:
- Very expensive and difficult to manufacture
- Enormous data that is very hard to handle
- Insufficient labelled data for training
Possibly this can be solved with [machine learning](https://www.netguru.com/blog/hyperspectral-imaging-applications)
### Spectrometers
![[110 Remote Sensing-1.png]]
![[110 Remote Sensing-2.png]]
Analyzes the spectral content of radiation - sometimes they use prisms! Can help find out the composition of things - in this case, three rock types that were noticeable as they absorb different parts of the spectrum, but that was impossible to tell with Landsat.
- [[MERIS]]

### Radiometers
Measures the intensity of radiation in some bands within the spectrum. Can cover different portions of the spectrum (visible, IR, microwave)
- [[ECOSTRESS]] (thermal infrared)
- [[VIIRS]]
- GOES
- *Visible* : Can show whether clouds are thicker or thinner, and where they turn to become hurricanes.
- *Infrared* : Can be used to distinguish low and high clouds, as low clouds are warmer. IR is available both day and night. 
- *Water vapor* : between 6.500 nm and 6.900 nm (lower infrared, but not usually noticeable by IR imagery, which is higher)

## Other facts
- **Polar orbits** cover the whole world, with low-earth being faster. Non-polar low-Earth orbit satellites only cover some latitudes.
- **Thermal sensors** are passive, but can collect data at night as it's emitted from the source and independent of the sun.
- **Sounders** can be active or passive, and they measure temperature, precipitation, humidity, cloud composition.
- **Radiometric resolution** indicates the ability of the sensor to detect small differences in energy, and show more detail in the terrain.
	- More relevant for old Landsat data (ETM, TM, MSS)
![[110 Remote Sensing-4.png]]
- **Processing levels** for NASA's products (GEDI, Landsat):
1. raw data
2. derived geophysical quantity
3. mapped to uniform space-time grid scales
4. combined with models or other instrument data

- The **nadir** is the point in the Earth directly below the satellite.

- A **datum** is a point in Earth that we use as a reference point for other locations.

- **Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS)**
	- *Geographic (WGS84)*: Good for large extents, bad for specific regions
	- *Projected (UTM)*: Good for specific regions, bad for large extents. UTM is cylindrical, so it's good for equatorial regions.
- **Larger wavelengths require larger apertures for same resolution**
	![[110 Remote Sensing-3.png]]
- **Plants reflect near-infrared very strongly!**
		And that reflectance changes with the season/growth stage... possibly also species??
- **We need atmospheric correction!**
		Much energy is absorbed and reflected by the atmosphere. 
![[Pasted image 20231009200418.png]]

- **It's hard to find something with high spectral, temporal AND spatial resolution**
		Landsat has high resolution, but only returns every 16 days. MODIS, on the other hand, returns every 1-2 days, but has a 500m resolution

Solved with constellations, such as [[Airbus]], [[Planet]] and [[Maxar]].
