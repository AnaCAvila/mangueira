Has worked with the Emberá communities in Ipetí, Panamá.

Part of my concerns about the project include:
- the role of agroforestry for diversifying diet and economy, besides being a traditional practice. Shouldn't it be prioritized in relation with timber plantations?
- timber is planted as monoculture stands. This will not restore habitat or diversity, and within 20 or so years the trees will be harvested and sold. Money coming in as occasional burts sounds like a less promising livelihood source than continuous income from agroforestry, and maintaining early years of growth is very labor intensive.
