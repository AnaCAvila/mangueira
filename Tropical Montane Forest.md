Montane forests grow above 1000m from sea level.
- called yungas in the Andes

## Montane cloud forest
Above 2000m from sea level, we have montane cloud forests.
- Most of the water comes from mist or fog
- Shorter trees, few fruits and mammals
- Full of moss and epiphytes (orchids and bromeliads!)

### (Sub) Alpine forest
Above 3.300m, there's much less rain and trees.
