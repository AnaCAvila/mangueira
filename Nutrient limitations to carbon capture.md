- Phosphorus and Nitrogen are both limiting and need to be taken into consideration. Mature forests can't keep on growing forever

[[allenModelingCarbonCost2020a]]

[[davidsonNITROGENPHOSPHORUSLIMITATION2004]] showed an increase in secondary forest growth with N and N+P treatments in Brazil, but no increase with P-only treatments (across 1999-2001). This is supported by [[davidsonRecuperationNitrogenCycling2007]] that shows young forests to be N limited, unlike mature tropical forests.
