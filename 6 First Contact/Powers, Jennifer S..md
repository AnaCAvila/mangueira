Has contact with Fiona!

I use experimental and observational approaches to investigate and biogeochemical and ecosystem processes across local, regional, and global scales. In particular, my research focuses on understanding:

- the patterns of carbon and nitrogen dynamics in forest ecosystems,
- the effects of anthropogenic environmental changes including land-cover change, global warming and nitrogen deposition on element cycling processes,
- the feedbacks among soil fertility, plant processes and microbial communities, and,
- how individual plant and microbial species influence element cycling processes.
