## Diversity statement

My native language, Portuguese, is the most similar to Spanish. Brazilians in general default to speaking "portuñol" in interactions with our hispanic neighbors, as some mimics and forced accents can usually get messages across. Also, any Latino can tell you that Brazil is like an estranged cousin, showing up for Christmases but not really a member of the family Whatsapp group. Still, from childhood, I've always been interested in the Latinness of Brazilian culture, and carefully invested in my Spanish skills to sound as native as possible in hopes to one day reunite with the rest of the cousins as one of their own.
My local astronomy club was my initial step into science. From high school, as a kid that had way too much interest in foreign languages, I have volunteered as the club's translator, which has pushed me further forward on my path to establish connections between Brazilian scientists and students with the rest of Latin America and the world. I see how much we can help each other. I also dont believe conservation can be done in isolation. As a scientist working on tropical forest conservation and regrowth, I realize how we are facing similar challenges and there is way too much unexplored potential for collaboration and knowledge exchange. In my education, I am working so that through my connections to Canada, Panama and Brazil can facilitate collaborations in common issues and student exchange.


## Abstract

Given the pressing climate crisis, regenerating deforested land has become an urgent matter. Secondary forests make up over half of tropical forests, and approximately one-third of the regrowth in the Neotropics is occurring on soil previously abandoned by agriculture. Different land use practices have been shown to greatly affect soil fertility, subsequently influencing regrowth rates on previously exhausted farmland. The surrounding landscape also plays a pivotal role in forest recovery, as the size and biodiversity of surrounding mature forests directly dictate the availability and functional composition of seeds dispersed to the depleted areas. However, these factors remain unexplored by regrowth models, which have focused on environmental predictors. Accurately estimating carbon accumulation is of utmost importance to policymaking, the establishment of protected areas, and climate projections. 

My research focuses on improving our current estimates of carbon accumulation in Neotropical secondary forests while exploring the effects of land use history and biodiversity. The project begins with a focus on secondary forests in the Brazilian Amazon. By leveraging remotely sensed land use maps encompassing 33 years of history and global carbon storage data, I am building a semi-mechanistic statistical model to predict forest regrowth in the Brazilian Amazon given environmental and anthropogenic predictors. The model has been preliminarily implemented in a region of the deforestation arc and is now being scaled up to the entire Brazilian Amazon. Subsequently, the model will be applied in Panama and Costa Rica, two data-rich biodiversity hotspots. In collaboration with Latin American scientists, I am expanding to Central America the machine learning-based land use classification method that was applied to Brazil, generating new land use history maps. This explores the applicability of the model to different socioecological scenarios from its initial training. This can inform decision-making in other countries and opens the possibility for future research in the Neotropics. Then, utilizing the S2BaK bias-adjusted biodiversity model for Panama and Costa Rica, biodiversity metrics can be integrated into the model. I incorporate alpha diversity and the presence of functional groups that have been shown to influence regrowth, such as nitrogen fixers and invasive grasses. This contributes to the discussion on biodiversity-biomass relationships and explores of a new possibility of improving carbon sequestration estimates. 

This research generates large-scale predictions of secondary forest growth and sheds light into the impact of biodiversity on biomass. By addressing the complexities that encompass the regeneration of deforested land, this project contributes to more efficient conservation strategies and sustainable land use policies in the Neotropical region.
