Proposed by [[Hubbell, Stephen]]. Assumes that the competition for resources is species-blind - you will compete with the individuals that want the same resource as you, regardless of whether they are of the same species or not. Niches are meaningless.

You end up with diverse communities of species that share the same niche, because they drift to extinction and new species arise randomly. Species can drift to extinction if they become too rare.

Brings the question of how ecologically similar are species.

[It works really well on models](https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-key-to-species-diversity-may-be-in-their-similarities-20230626/), probably because although it is simplistic it does represent nature well enough.

Demographic noise - when a species will have lower mortality vs high mortality, or lower reproductive rates vs high reproductive rates - having similar amplitudes in their fluctuations throughout life history - can help mediate diversity.
