#### Notes:

 > <span style="color: #F9E076">When applying to larger spatial scales, a benchmark classification of phenologically different forest types is required and the method needs to be applied separately to the different forest classes that have different phenological patterns, making the AVOCADO algorithm increasingly laborious with increasing spatial scales</span>

 

 > <span style="color: #F9E076">AVOCADO is sensitive to gradual changes and thereby able to accuratelydetect forest degradation and forest regrowth;</span>
