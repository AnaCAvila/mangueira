#### Notes:


    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">There has been an increasing awareness of the possibility of climate change causing increased drought frequency in Amazonia,</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #F9E076">we first calculated the monthly WDs based on the approximation that a moist tropical canopy transpires  100 mm month 1. This value is derived from the mean evapotranspiration obtained by ground measurements in different locations and seasons in Amazonia</span>
    

    
> <span style="color: #90EE90">We analysed the spatial extent of these droughts and fire response to the 2005 drought with TRMM and NOAA-12 data, respectively.</span>
