## Daily report
Spent the morning resting. For the first time in a while, it was hard to get to work. I understand it was hard to sleep late and wake up early, also the intimidation of having to finally face my very messy code. Now, however, I am ready to do it.

## Self
Still having a hard time avoiding friends that I want to see less. I need to be honest and tell people that I can't go hang out, that I'm truly too busy.
