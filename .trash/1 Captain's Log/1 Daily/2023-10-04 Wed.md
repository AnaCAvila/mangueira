## Daily report
Lots of bureaucracy to work out today. Managed to set everything up nicely so that now I can only focus on my work. Getting better at prioritizing and leaving less important tasks for later.
## Make it so
```tasks
due today
short view
```
### Due soon
```tasks
not done
due after today before in one week
hide backlink
```
## Daily Review

Exhausted, but still haven't done enough. Still, spent the day doing things that I needed to do regardless. Tomorrow I will focus more on my actual research.
