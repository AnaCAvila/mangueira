### Ana's Brain
By tomorrow, I can have all of the work done. I really only need this done by tomorrow at 5 pm - it's enough time if I'm objective about it.

Panicked a bit about not having enough time for everything, but it will all get done soon. It's okay!

Reading during Pomodoro breaks actually sounds like a great idea...
