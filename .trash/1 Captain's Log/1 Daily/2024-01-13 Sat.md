## Sea cucumber and snorkel day

### Sea cucumber farming
We visited an aquaculture facility near Col√≥n. The company, PanaSea, collects sea cucumbers from the seagrass during their egg-laying season, which is 4 days before every full or new moon.
I appreciate the idea of a project that works on commercialization of a natural product, while also working on the restoration of ecosystems through mangrove seedlings and reintroduction of sea cucumbers into the depleted seagrass.

It was interesting to learn how mangrove seedlings can choose where to settle by controlling their buoyancy. One more point on corals and plants and plankton having more choice than we'd give them credit for. 

It was really disappointing to see the presentation by a French masters' student that had no results and spoke as if he did, with terribly insignificant plots. It was, however, an interesting opportunity to converse with Jarrod on keeping expectations high and toxicity low in academia by providing feedback when it's warranted while never assuming malintent.

### Snorkeling
The beach has the most coral skeleton that I've ever seen. It's incredibly shallow with few waves. Seabirds are either small andorinhas or large pelicans, no seagulls or albatrosses to be seen. I'm sure there's medium sized birds somewhere.

Seagrass bed was beautiful, with interesting round algae (Penicill) and colourful fish living within it.
Coral reef seemed surprisingly degraded. 
Absence of:
- starfish
- large crustaceans
- sharks
- turtles
- jellyfish
Little presence of:
- small crustaceans
- schools of fish
Plenty of:
- fire coral
- non-schooling like damselfish and butterflyfish
- dead patches
- bleached coral
Notable presence:
- large barracuda (at least 1m)
- large blowfish

The reef reminded me a lot of Arraial do Cabo, but with no coral-sol to be seen, and very warm shallow waters. Arraial, however, has larger reef fish and more sea turtles, and is in an upwelling zone.
### Conversation with Carrie
#### Random thoughts
- corals are animals, so they are not equal to trees in the sense that the larvae do have some matter of choice of where to settle. There are some interesting similarities between coral reefs and forest ecosystems.
- ==theoretical modelling of metaecosystem dispersal would be also nicely applied to coral reefs. Unlike large land predators, large marine predators can disperse more easily without the impedement of roads and farms.==
- segmentation modelling can also be done to identify coral species in coral reefs. There are also 
#### Coral morphology

- The corals grow in different shapes depending on the environment, like plasticity in trees. A coral can also change its phenotype depending on its lifetime.
- Corals can hybridize into chimeras.
- Distinguishing species can be hard. Molecular evidence and reproductive studies are conducted for the answer.
-  One "mouth" is one individual! So what looks like an individual "coral" is a colony of many little mouths bundled together, each one belonging to an individual. They are characterized based on:
	- colony shape
	- the sharing of walls (shared, separate, absent)
	- Septa, costae, septo-costae
#### Bleaching and invasive corals
##### bleaching
- They get rid of their zooxanthellae as oxygen reactive species become too much of a problem. The tissue gets discolored. It can recover if this is not long.
##### has a bleached region ever been successfully restored?
- not yet :(((( there are efforts, a largest one done in Florida, but no reef recovered yet

Percentage of living coral cover of what are coral communities.

- corals have different life strategies - stress-tolerant slow growing, stress-intolerant fast growers, and unstable life strategies.
Photogrametry is also used here to measure tree cover.
- Disease also affects coral communities, as well as storms, temperature rise and pH. Diseases are more of a common issue in the caribbean, as it suffers from lots of direct sewage pollution and agriculture runoff (deforestation kills corals too! through sedimentation).
- Many oil spills are also an issue around Panama.


#### Symbiosis
- the endosymbiosis of zooxanthellae and corals provides them with food but also restricts their range based on the range of the symbiont. They can shift their ranges and shift back depending on the conditions. Also, there needs to be the ideal conditions for coral to grow. One of which is low nutrients, because where there are algae they suffer from competition with algae.
- There's a large range of environments you can find 
- coral and symbiotic relationship with algae - do most of them do it?
	- the vast majority of corals in the photic zone has zooxanthellae. many in more darkness do not.
- some corals do have pigments.
