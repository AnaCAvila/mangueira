## Daily report
Crossed many things off the to-do list. Had to spend some time doing management.
### Daily review
Thinking I may TA in Panama next year. It probably would be good for my experience, actually. I could also be away from Canada all winter. I am considering flying Montreal-Pan-Rio-Pan-Montreal for about three months. Seems like the course I'd TA would be environmental history of latin america with daviken. Let's see how that goes. Also, I'd get to help Jorge with fieldwork.
## Self

Realizing how all week I've worked and didn't register what I've done on google calendar or otherwise. 
Also haven't exercised or kept a steady routine. Been desperate working late and waking up late, which is definitely not ideal.
I need to cross things off my "things to worry about" list. That includes other people, plants, and too many responsibilities. It's going much better now, but it can definitely improve.
Have improved the system of organizing my tasks so I don't get so overwhelmed by them.
