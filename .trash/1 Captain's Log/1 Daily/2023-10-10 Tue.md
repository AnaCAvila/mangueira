## Daily report
Went to see Daviken. He gave me a good summary of historical ecology, ecological anthropology and ecological economy. Overall was an interesting day. Also visited the GIS lab and learned how to upload my data. It has as much RAM as Janus, which is awesome.

## Self
Gave my presentation on remote sensing to the star party. I learned a lot about remote sensing in the process and really got started with working on obsidian. It was also overall a chill evening.
