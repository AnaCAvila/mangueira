## Abstract

> A non-technical abstract of not more than 250 words.

Given the pressing climate crisis, regenerating deforested land has become an urgent matter. Secondary forests make up over half of tropical forests, and approximately one-third of the regrowth in the Neotropics is occurring on soil previously abandoned by agriculture. Different land use practices have been shown to greatly affect soil fertility, subsequently influencing regrowth rates on previously exhausted farmland. The surrounding landscape also plays a pivotal role in forest recovery, as the size and biodiversity of surrounding mature forests directly dictate the availability and functional composition of seeds dispersed to the depleted areas. However, these factors remain unexplored by regrowth models, which have focused on environmental predictors. Accurately estimating carbon accumulation is of utmost importance to policymaking, the establishment of protected areas, and climate projections.

My research focuses on **improving our current estimates of carbon accumulation in Neotropical secondary forests while exploring the effects of land use history and biodiversity**. By leveraging remotely sensed land use maps encompassing 33 years of history and global carbon storage data, I am building a semi-mechanistic statistical model to predict forest regrowth given environmental and anthropogenic predictors. The model has been preliminarily implemented in a region of the deforestation arc and is now being scaled up to the entire Brazilian Amazon. Subsequently, the **model will be applied in Panama and Costa Rica**, two data-rich biodiversity hotspots. In collaboration with Latin American scientists, I am expanding to Central America the machine learning-based land use classification method that was applied to Brazil, generating new land use history maps. This explores the applicability of the model to different socioecological scenarios from its initial training. This can inform decision-making in other countries and opens the possibility for future research in the Neotropics.

This research generates large-scale predictions of secondary forest growth and sheds light into the impact of biodiversity on biomass. By addressing the complexities that encompass the regeneration of deforested land, this project contributes to **more efficient conservation strategies and sustainable land use policies in the Neotropical region**.
