[[Heinrich et al 2021 - Large carbon sink potential of secondary forests in the Brazilian Amazon to mitigate climate change]]
- Separated plots by category, used ESA biomass and mapbiomas to calculate mean AGBD per age. Median was used.

- Estimated carbon gains and losses by changes in extent of secondary forests.
- No carbon info was used. Used #mapbiomas classes.
- This study does not account for variation by prior land use, climate, soil, or seed sources.
