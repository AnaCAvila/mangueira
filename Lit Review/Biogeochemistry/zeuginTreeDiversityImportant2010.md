## Notes
  

Biodiversity tended to increase N and P pools, but not consistently – weak effect. 

Complementarity effect – niche separation of species, resource partitioning. 

N and P pools were largely defined by environmental conditions (58%) 

Presence of nutrient-demanding species may deplete soil and be adverse to biomass increase. 

Intermediate diversity brought biggest increases in three-species mixtures rather than monocultures vs 6 species. 

The study was done over two years, in Sardinilla Panama, with 3 different amounts of species.
