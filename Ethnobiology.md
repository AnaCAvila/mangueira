Ethnobiology is the scientific study of dynamic relationships among peoples, biota, and environments. As a multidisciplinary field, ethnobiology integrates archaeology, geography, systematics, population biology, ecology, mathematical biology, cultural anthropology, ethnography, pharmacology, nutrition, conservation, and sustainable development.

In the past, many ethnobiologists concentrated on cataloging long lists of plants and animals with their associated preparations and uses. More recently our research objectives have become more process-oriented. For example, we now study how species are domesticated and the origins and development of agriculture;  the management of useful plant and animal populations;  and process of traditional knowledge acquisition and organization.
