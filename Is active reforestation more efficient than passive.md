- [[Nobre, Carlos A.]] says 50-60% of the Amazon can recover on its own, but the rest will need to be actively replanted. One main reason for this would be distance to mature forest, in areas deep in agricultural land.
- However, this would be incredibly expensive and depend on seed availability.
- One option to fund this would be through [[Carbon Credits]] such as what is being done with [[AXA fund to invest $49 million in Brazil reforestation projects]].

[[Berenguer, Erika]] does not support active reforestation as it may not support biodiversity conservation and the provision of ecosystem services.

Nobre estimates that, in addition to stopping deforestation, some 700,000 square kilometers in the southern Amazon would need restoration to ensure that a death spiral isnâ€™t triggered. More than half of that area would naturally regenerate if left alone for nearby jungle to reclaim it, according to his rough calculations.
