at-a-glance: UN agreement for reducing emissions from deforestation in developing countries
---
> [!note] Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation
> It's a method for incentive and planning of forest conservation and regeneration by developing countries, based on incentives by developed countries. In short, **a payment for ecosystem services scheme**. 


**1992 - United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)** - Started in the 1992 Rio Convention, like the UN Convention on Biological Diversity and the Convention to Combat Desertification. Went into effect in 1994.

**1997 - Protocolo de Kyoto** - Entrou em vigor em 2005. Começou as exigências que países membros de UNFCCC diminuam emissões. *Started REDD.*

**2007 - UN-REDD** - A partnership between the FAO, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and UN Development Programme (UNDP) to help developing countries reach the goals needed so they can take part in REDD+. *There was funding by UN-REDD for countries to implement the first stages of the REDD+ framework - that money ran out by 2020.*

**2008 - REDD+** - REDD was updated to include the conservation of existing forests.

**2013 - Warsow International Mechanism for Loss and Damage (WIM)** - First step to address how to compensate developing countries for losses related to climate change. Established what each country needs to have implemented to receive benefits.

**2015 - Paris Agreement** - Legally binding international treaty to keep temperature increases below 1.5 degrees.

## Funding
- The [Forest Carbon Partnership Facility](https://www.forestcarbonpartnership.org/) provides "Readiness Funds" to REDD+ - comes from a partnership of governments, companies and donors.
