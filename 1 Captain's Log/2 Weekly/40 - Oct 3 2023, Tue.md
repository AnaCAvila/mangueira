- [ ] Write [[Remote Sensing Summary|summary]] on LU classification and SAR biomass options
	- [ ] Email contacts: Jonathas/Jude/Javier/Beth 
	- [ ] How did ESA Biomass measure SD? (Bear in mind the SD of early biomass values can be larger because there's more variability in the residuals in early trajectories)
	- [ ] How did ESA Biomass incorporate GEDI - and what does that mean for systemic bias aka more issues with lower biomass values?
- [ ] Analyze basin-wide data
	- [ ] Document differences between fits across medians and means across the basin
	- [ ] Map the residuals across the basins - see how standard deviations are larger in lower biomass plots
	- [ ] Mask out urban areas
	- [ ] Check out MAPBIOMAS land use map - is it reliable, do the classifications look legit?
- [ ] Incorporating new data
	- [ ] Indigenous land
	- [ ] Protected areas
	- [ ] Mature forest cover and biomass
	- [ ] Water deficit and AET - check differences in datasets, as well as regionality and magnitude
	- [ ] Soil

## Weekly Report
Learned a lot with the FRQNT application. Also, got a good sustainable setup with Obsidian for pretty much everything. Still some maintenance to be done, but there always will be some. Also some advances with handling large data, started work with QGIS and Google Earth, which are super helpful.
### Self
Very focused on work, everything is going well.
