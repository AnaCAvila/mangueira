## Weekly Report

### Self
Been more stressed this week with my mom's health, and with so many things that I have to do.
Everything is done now regarding Obsidian - there's no need to organize things as actual tasks to do (update notes, so on and so forth) - things will be organized now on the go, as the need appears.
