## Weekly Report
Learned a lot with the FRQNT application. Also, got a good sustainable setup with Obsidian for pretty much everything. Still some maintenance to be done, but there always will be some. Also some advances with handling large data, started work with QGIS and Google Earth, which are super helpful.
### Self
Very focused on work, everything is going well.
