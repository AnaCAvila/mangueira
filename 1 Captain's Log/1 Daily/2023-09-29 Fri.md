## Priorities for today

Finish the organization of the vault and the tags so we can move on to adding review notes to obsidian.
## Daily report
### Research
Helped out Fiona with her writing. FRQNT really made me better prepared to deal with this kind of thing.
### Ana's Brain
I'm sleep deprived a bit, as I couldn't let go of this to fall asleep - also haven't eaten much today, as I also couldn't let go of this. the hyperfocus is real. I don't think it's much the fault of the medication though.

## Priorities for tomorrow

Add tasks to daily note and the bridge
Prioritize tasks / plan week
Finish tag organization
Add references properly to Obsidian
Finish referencing and experiences file
Submit FRQNT
Organize code
