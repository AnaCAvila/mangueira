## Daily report

Wrote email to INPA. Which is pretty much the same email to send to STRI

Organizing tasks and files to avoid the overwhelm. So far so good.
- Realizing I really don't have the time to organize everything. I need to finish with what I've got, do the committee meeting, finish the urgent stuff, and then between the meeting and the trip (three weeks, more than enough!) take the time to organize my notes and my thinking.
- If I need to organize so bad, I better organize my code.

### Daily review
## Make it so
