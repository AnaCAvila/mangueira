## Seaweed farming

Note: the sky here is absolutely beautiful, and these nighttime seascapes would make stunning astrophotography.

### Construction

The mayor mentioned how beaches are protected and houses cannot be built within less than 20 or 30 m from the sea. However, we are sleeping in a house a few steps away from the sea. I have a feeling we have been very excited about something illegal.

### Education

On connecting with Daniel on [[2024-01-11 Thu]], we talked about education and its role in forest conservation, as well as livelihoods. This seems to be part of every successful conservation project, like the TAMAR in Brazil - where turtle fishermen were given jobs in ecotourism and taught the importance of turtles to the ecosystem to the tourists instead of killing them - and the jaguar conservation project in Panama, where camera traps were installed in campesinos' properties so they could see the jaguars in their land and relate to them. I would be curious to gather stories from other successful ecological awareness projects  and what they have in common across ecosystems.

Also, ==I am curious about the difference between the attitudes of fishermen across both oceans on sea turtle and shark fishing==, and what that means for the populations of these two animals.

### Gloria Batista: Seaweed aquaculture and indigenous peoples

Very exciting to see an older generation latin american female scientist being a leader in her field.

Mapping in her era was extremely difficult. Daviken and her both believe that using paper maps can be beneficial (and in her case, drawing the maps yourself) for understanding of geography. ==Mapping seagrass and different types of coral reefs is harder to do on satellite than manually.==

Gloria and her husband are the first people to plant marine algae in Central America. He worked on an oil refinery, and at that time there was a large oil spill. The worker of the refinery met the marine biologist Gloria to try to protect the environment and they've been married for 25 years. They wanted to recover what was damaged from the spill.

She started developing a macroalgae project. Now they sell marine algae to Europe. The company has existed for as long as they've been together.

[[Ecosystemology]] is a book she introduced to us.

At some point, the library they built was destroyed by the American soldiers during the Panamanian invasion.

There is a division of labour in seaweed farming - women prepare the seeds, men plant them into the ocean. They can be planted with low water, but with sea level rise it can become too deep for the algae and generates tall waves.

In Colón, people sell dry algae to be consumed as drinks. They produce algae with indigenous peoples.
The government has invited them to do projects with carbon sequestration but they don't work with it yet. They are not sure if this is a truly useful solution or if it is an attempt of governments to greenwash.

#### Guna people usage of algae for food and medicine
[Las algas brindan nuevas oportunidades a los pescadores indígenas en Panamá | Historias de la FAO | Organización de las Naciones Unidas para la Alimentación y la Agricultura](https://www.fao.org/fao-stories/article/es/c/1538466/)

She noticed that Guna people were working with macroalgae. It is healthy for stomach, as people were ill from hunger and constantly changing diets.
She published much about the indigenous and caribbean afroantillanos usage of algae.
The local inaduledi (pajé) would help classify the algae. They were used for healing as well as chants and dances. The inaduledi communicates with auxiliares that treat the ill, diagnose, practice infirmary, and attend epidemics.

There has been good documentation of how these people use land plants, but this was a new project that incorporated algae.

**How is the market for these algae, and do the same people also work with sustainable agriculture and/or agroforestry?**
- The Guna people mainly live in islands so they are very reliant on the sea. They have been moved to the land due to sea level rise. Historically they lived on land, but the Spaniards expelled many of them to the sea. However, there are still some on land and some in Colombia.

Panama is the first country (at least in Latin America an the Caribbean) that have started a program to move communities due to climate change

I'm remembering a really cool [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3835452/#:~:text=The%20Kuna%20Indians%20who%20reside,least%20on%20their%20death%20certificates.) I read with regards to the Guna people and heart disease, back in the 1990s. The study showed that the Guna originally had no heart disease issues, and as they moved to the city they started developing heart disease issues.

Algae can be an interesting food supplement - the guna of san blas (guna yala), that consume algae, are taller and more robust than the guna of bayano. The difference can be attributed to diet or physical conditions.

New skin for burns can be made from algae.
