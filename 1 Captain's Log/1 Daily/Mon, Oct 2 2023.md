## Daily report
### Research
Getting the data merged - do the bare minimum, then move on to the fancy things.

Getting lost and overwhelmed, means it's time to go back to the drawing board and take one task at a time.

- What regions may cause more systematic bias?
	- People who know remote sensing haven't worked with GEDI before.
- See if the variation within patch corresponds with error rates.
- Fallow periods could be correlated with error rates or bias?
- Sparse matrices can be easier to handle. It's the structure that you want in R.
- Where do the biases matter? Where do the biases cause weighting to cause problems?
- Could very high variance cause to eliminate patches with very low or very high weight?
