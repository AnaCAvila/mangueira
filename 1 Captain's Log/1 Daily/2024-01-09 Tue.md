## 07/01/2024 - From Arduino to BCI

- Costa Rican regeneration success is largely due to payments for ecosystem services established since the 80s.

It was cool to work with Arduino for the first time, and have some of that feeling of curious play that the pressure of academia has beat out of me. I do have a lot that I want to learn, and a bunch of opportunities that would require me a whole year off to just study if I wanted to do everything, and I am incredibly curious, but way too overwhelmed to really just take my time, slow down, and play as I learn new things without the pressure of having a specific goal to be achieved.

I'm realizing I would've enjoyed circuits and physics labs much better if they had been taught like this, and I'd be excited to try to customize things at home using an arduino.
