### Research
#### Meeting
Include data sources into the readme file. Pipelines should be helpful to write my methods.
GIS McGill data storage may be a good way to store large files. Ask Katie!

Initial biomass may be badly classified by SAR. I wonder if ESA did a better job.
How they incorporate GEDI and SAR - simple averaging?

Save data into hard drive.
Make sparse matrices to store data.
Everything in a dataframe - also an option. It's context specific.

Document differences between fits across medians and means across the basin.
Map the residuals across the basin too - check if standard deviations are larger in lower biomasses.
How is standard deviation calculated in ESA CCI?
Bear in mind the SD can be wider because there's more variability in the residuals in early trajectories.
Mask out urban areas.
Check out land use map - is it reliable, do the classifications look legit?
Whether growth rates are different in protected areas could be interesting! If you're surrounded by other trees, there's higher seed rain.
Indigenous land as well.

There are issues with shrubland classification in Panama, they are often misclassified as secondary forests.
