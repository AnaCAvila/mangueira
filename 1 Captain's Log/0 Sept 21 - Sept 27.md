Visit Daviken from 1-2 PM. Ask about agroforestry in Panama and the field course.
## Sept 26, Tuesday

Stats class in the morning.
Go to lab and focus on coding.
TA meeting in the afternoon, then can come home and code some more.

## Sept 25, Monday

Start coding on Monday morning, 9AM.
Rest/study in the evening, prepare for coming week.
## Sept 24, Sunday

Coding. Work on the code FIRST - then, for the evening, weekend menu or time to read papers/study.

Spent some time becoming good at [[Github]]. Everything is smooth now and making perfect sense. Vault is backed up, so is my code. Ready to organize everything across Polaris, Janus and Athina!



## Sept 23, Saturday

In the morning/afternoon, errands were run, and what was left to set up with Obsidian/some light weekend menu things were done.

Started organizing code, but got lost looking at different institutes and research networks at the Amazon. Emailed a Aliança pela Restauração da Amazônia porque eu acho que isso pode talvez me gerar alguns contatos bons, não custa tentar.

Amanhã, acordo cedo e sigo nos objetivos principais.

## Sept 22, Friday

Met friend for most of the day.

In the evening, got a bit of the weekend menu done.
## Sept 21, Thursday

- The morning was rough. Trying to put emotions aside and be practical, but it's okay to account for that kind of issue happening, we're not machines. In the meantime, managed to get some stats studying done and read a few articles.

## Weekly goals

- [ ] incorporate error from [[ESA Biomass]].
	- With the size of the error bars, we can weigh their effect on the final AGB estimate.

- [ ] Incorporate data from the rest of the forest - not just a small region
	- Do the same for the forest age
	- Check if there's differences in the relationship across the biome.

- [ ] Investigate all other predictors:
	- soil
	- CWD (check regionality/magnitude)
	- Mature forest cover
	- AET

## Weekend menu
- [ ] Finish and submit FRQNT
- [ ] Draft slides for FSCI 198
- [ ] Organize code
- [ ] Contacts that went cold: Jonathas/Jude/Javier/Beth
	Write email on LU classification and SAR biomass
- [ ] Email Brian about Panama
- [ ] Email everyone about being sick
- [ ] Merge data in QGIS

- [x] Incorporate new branch on GitHub to test changes
- [/] Plan time investment/schedules
	So far, I feel like it's okay to keep things fluid for the most part. There's always going to be a ton of unpredictability, also as the seasons change. Setting up a morning and bedtime routine, and time tracking, would be a smarter strategy.
- [x] Explore admonition/[excalidraw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB4cOfn0xAs)/list callouts
- [x] adding author names as links from zotero to obsidian
		Just do it manually for only the authors that are relevant
- [x] Look up what would be good image management on obsidian. it seems like adding photos to no end is a waste of space.
- [x] Go over undergrad research. Maybe running this through Fred would be an interesting exercise and potential publication?
- [x] Pesquisar Instituto Serrapilheira e Ciencia Fundamental. Talvez eu possa escrever pra lá além do The Conversation?
