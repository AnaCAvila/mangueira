- get helmet back!
- get book from law library
## Sept 18th, Monday

Finished writing the main parts. Chat GPT is very helpful to find better ways of phrasing things, but the abstract needs a lot of work. To finish FRQNT I need to cite and finish my CV, which I can always do after the meeting with the lab.

For today, I will:
- get the abstract in good shape
- I will get ESA GlobBiomass and GEDI and get plotting.
### Lab meeting
What different sources of error can come in?
- How was error measured? This can affect consequences of the error on the result.
	- Would selective logging lead to errors in biomass?
- Run the model at every step and see what happens.
Think how 100m biomass values would relate to the land use values - do we have mean biomass per 100m?

Considering the possibility of joining Scientista mentorship. I know that Max Jousse is also organizing mentorship events with QLS that happen every last Monday of the month, but that I can't attend because of lab meeting. Scientista mentorship is due this saturday so I have time to think before signing up.

Just set up obsidian on android, and adding new zotero files on android as well.

## Sept 17th, Sunday

Finished up more of setting up Obsidian, spent most of the day with Hossein's family. Must finish writing and coding - will do that today, tomorrow and Tuesday. Must prioritize. It's okay - meetings will happen and progress is being made. One day at a time.

## Sept 16th, Saturday
Housework, talking to family.
Basic maintenance of saved information, organization.
There are many things I'd like to do - gotta go one at a time, and prioritize.
- Finishing FRQNT application
- Organizing code
Thinking whether I can use some of what I'm studying - agriculture in latin america, nutrient dynamics - to write scicomm articles.
Consider The Conversation?

Spent some time getting things done for family and getting better acquainted to the Obsidian system. It's okay, I will use it on a daily basis going forward.

Reassessing weekly goals based on meeting with Andrew.

## Sept 15th, Friday
Foi um dia de reuniões interessantes.
### Meeting with Andrew
statistical rethinking - book recommended
Remember the difference between error of real data and standard deviation of expected values.
with the size of the error bars, we can weigh their effect on the final AGB estimate.
### Meeting with Martín Giraldo
Had an interesting conversation about potential of agroforestry in Latin America - began the [[MOC Social Context of Latin America]] page to write down notes on the topic going forward.

Also, some progress was made with FRQNT application.
## Sept 14th, Thursday

Ran a bunch of errands - at the end of the day I got some writing done for FRQNT.
## Weekly goals

- [ ] incorporate error from [[GEDI]] and [[ESA GlobBiomass]].
	- With the size of the error bars, we can weigh their effect on the final AGB estimate.

- [ ] Incorporate data from the rest of the forest - not just a small region
	- Do the same for the forest age
	- Check if there's differences in the relationship across the biome.

- [ ] Incorporate new branch on GitHub to test changes

- [ ] Investigate all other predictors:
	- soil
	- CWD (check regionality/magnitude)
	- Mature forest cover
	- AET

Keep in mind:
- Always to ask questions from readings
- Always to verify how much data was removed, and how does its distribution look like - including the distribution of the removed data.

## Weekend menu

[x] look into BIOS2 courses
[x] Check up on Javier/Jacob contact
	added on to do when looking at remote sensing
[x] Using Obsidian Dataview:
	[How to use the Obsidian Dataview plugin - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTObSymEvWA)
[x] Check how to add authors as tags
	no need - can just make dataview list with desired author for folder ""
[x] Linking bookmarks to obsidian - say, can I add links from papers to the statistical methods I describe in my book?
	done
[x] try to introduce highlights into obsidian as different text colors, not highlight indices
