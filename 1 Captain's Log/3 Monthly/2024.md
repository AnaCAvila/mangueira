### Reading

The goal is to read at least 15 papers a week (including while travelling) and a few books.

Reading 30 papers is 5% of the goal. 20 days of reading 30 papers each goes through the whole pile! that's ten weekends of reading! Not that bad.

Make detailed study plan
Reading philosophy and the humanities will be its own designated study time - to bring in notes from books, for example.

Studying statistics will be scheduled time over the weekend.
