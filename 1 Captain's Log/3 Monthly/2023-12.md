2 days to plan studying stats and writing papers for the coming year
Read papers, count how long it takes to go over them on average.
Make a study plan to go over 1. basic stats and 2. bayesian.

The goal is to read at least 15 papers a week (including while travelling) and a few books.

Reading philosophy and the humanities will be its own designated study time - to bring in notes from books, for example.

Studying statistics will be scheduled time over the weekend.

Reading 30 papers is 5% of the goal. 20 days of reading 30 papers each goes through the whole pile! that's ten weekends of reading! Not that bad.
