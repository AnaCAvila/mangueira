### LiDAR may have issues in steep terrain or dense forest

Uncertainties in digital terrain models (DTM) can cause issues in canopy height estimates.

[[ICESat1 - GLAS & ICESat2 - ATLAS]] was the first LiDAR system developed.

>[!info] It has also been used in space missions!


LiDAR uses near-infrared laser.
