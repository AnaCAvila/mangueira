Is an active sensor - shoots near infrared light towards the Earth. Measures the return time interval and intensity.

[[ICESat1 - GLAS & ICESat2 - ATLAS]] was the first LiDAR system developed.

[[GEDI]] is the first high resolution lidar from space.



### How is forest height calculated - and then biomass?


## Other facts
- LASER stands for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation
- It has also been used in space missions
- There is cloud and aerosol LiDAR (also on GLAS)
- **Laser altimeter** (like GLAS) uses LiDAR to measure topography (height of the surface in relation to mean earth surface)

## Limitations
- Cloud cover - LiDAR actually cannot penetrate clouds!
- Steep terrain
- Dense forest
- Uncertainties in digital terrain models (DTM) can cause issues in canopy height estimates.

## Airborne LiDAR

Has been used for archaeological missions.
