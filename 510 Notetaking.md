**1. Always take fleeting notes**
**2. Be selective with what you write down**
	Hardest part for me, for sure. Must let go of the FOMO and not write literally everything down.
**3. Make notes permanent, connected, developed, argued**
	Get notes from fleeting to processed ASAP!
**4. Link, transfer, associate the notes**
	Keep structures simple so it's easier to flow.
**5. Write around already-developed notes**
	Writing more, since that is where ideas happen.

How to Take Smart Notes - Sonke Ahrens is a book that summarizes the Zettelkasten system.

[Anki](http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html) is a flashcard system that helps memorize specific things. Could be useful for language learning, or terminology. For now I don't feel an immediate need to add it as a task, but if in the future I want to do anything with it, there's a way to link it to Obsidian.
