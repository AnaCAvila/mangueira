## Poe and Science

Poe was fascinated with science, but also annoyed at its coldness at approaching facts. 

In Eureka, his last work, he intends to share only truths about science. He even says his work will be more important one day than Newton's laws - incredibly arrogant!

Still, it's an awesome work of insight and creativity over nature. His view on the paradox of why the sky is not completely taken over by stars is super interesting.
