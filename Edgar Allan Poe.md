## Poe and Science

Poe was fascinated with science, but also annoyed at its coldness at approaching facts. 

In Eureka, his last work, he intends to share only truths about science. He even says his work will be more important one day than Newton's laws - incredibly arrogant!

Still, it's an awesome work of insight and creativity over nature. His view on the paradox of why the sky is not completely taken over by stars is super interesting.

### Sonnet -To Science
Science! true daughter of Old Time thou art!  

   Who alterest all things with thy peering eyes.  

Why preyest thou thus upon the poet’s heart,  

   Vulture, whose wings are dull realities?  

How should he love thee? or how deem thee wise,  

   Who wouldst not leave him in his wandering  

To seek for treasure in the jewelled skies,  

   Albeit he soared with an undaunted wing?  

Hast thou not dragged Diana from her car,  

   And driven the Hamadryad from the wood  

To seek a shelter in some happier star?  

   Hast thou not torn the Naiad from her flood,  

The Elfin from the green grass, and from me  

The summer dream beneath the tamarind tree?
