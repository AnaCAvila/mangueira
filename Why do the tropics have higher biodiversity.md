**Cradle**: Most species are born in the tropics. Like the paper that showed the Amazon as a source of species.

**Museum**: Species go extinct less often in the tropics, so it's full of old species.

**Destination**: Species end up moving there.

We know that in the tropics, the vast majority of species are rare, and few species make up most of the forest.

[[Niche Theory]] says each species occupies a discrete niche and if there is overlap, there is competitive exclusion.

[[Neutral Theory]] assumes all niches overlap and biodiversity patterns are species-blind.

In reality, the world is probably somewhere in the middle:

[[Jansen-Connell hypothesis]] would explain that if it is impossible to grow next to your parent species, so species tend to be rare to avoid natural enemies.
