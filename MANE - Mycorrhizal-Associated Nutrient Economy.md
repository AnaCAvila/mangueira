[Philips et al 2013 - The mycorrhizal-associated nutrient economy: a new framework forpredicting carbonâ€“nutrient couplings in temperate forests](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/nph.12221?src=getftr) proposes that there are different biogeochemical needs to soils that contain more plants that associate with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi vs ectomycorrhizal fungi.
