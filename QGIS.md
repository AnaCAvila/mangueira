- generate NAs

GRASS


1- remove all zeroes. Make sure there's NAs instead of zeroes when and where possible
2- align rasters.


- frequency within 100m?
- iterative biomass predictions - use one prediction to infer the next? 
	- bayesian?
	- imputation

model - get mean predicted value by squares and compare that with the individual ones

dont forget that high sd would regardless introduce bias at some levels more than others even if it has biological drivers!
