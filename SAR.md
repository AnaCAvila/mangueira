It's called synthetic aperture as it uses a very large antenna that moves in a way that it artificially acts as if it's a much larger aperture ([great explanation!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2bUKEi9It4))

It can image through clouds, as well as day or night.

SAR is dependent on the *structure* and *moisture*.

**Dielectric constant** measures how easily a dipolar molecule (such as water!) will rotate in response to an electromagnetic field.
- water molecules rotate easily in response to the micro/radiowaves
- so water reflects a ton of energy back!
- more soil moisture = more backscatter = brighter returns

**Polarization** is the orientation in the plane in which the wave oscillates:
- Signals emitted in vertical and received in vertical are often a result of rough terrain
- Signals emitted in horizontal and received in horizontal are often a result of buildings (double bounce)
- A mix of both is a result of dense vegetation or highly porous soil (sand, dry soil)
- the ratio of HH to VV is an indicator of moisture content (moisture is depolarizing)

**Penetration depth** increases with wavelength and decreases with moisture
- Physics - large wavelength means lower frequency, which means more penetration depth.

Interferometry is an analysis method that shows changes in the land topography in between two observations of the same target. Can be used to identify volcanic eruptions and earthquakes down to the centimeter!

Can be useful for *land use classification* as structure varies significantly across different crop types!
